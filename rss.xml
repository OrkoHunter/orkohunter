&lt;p&gt;10 years ago, I arrived as a naive fresher in my engineering college. And like many, my first year was pretty bad in terms of both social and academic growth. I made very little effort to make new friends, skipped most classes, scored 7 point something CGPA and had no idea what I was going to do in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I had prior understanding of programming, my first hands-on keyboard experience was my Data Structures and Algorithms course. Those juicy Sun Microsystems computers and fully air conditioned labs used to put me to sleep after lunch. I was a slow learner in that class. I was started struggling a lot when the time came to implement linked lists or perform string manipulations in character arrays. Segmentation Fault used to be the highlight of most days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow, I managed to pass all the exams and started doing all the random things college freshers do in India - soldering thin wires on an iron plate, mistaking flasks for bowls in chemistry labs while wearing thick white coats and shovelling soil. We all have done it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second semester started and something was missing. Not that long ago, I had cracked IIT JEE, what is supposed to be country&apos;s most difficult engineering exam which everyone writes. Millions. And I was top 2000 in the country. Not too bad, eh? And here I was, clueless about life. And it was not just me, others were clueless just like me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is when my &lt;em&gt;bhaiya&lt;/em&gt; told me about Open Source and Google Summer of Code. &lt;em&gt;&quot;Create a GitHub profile and start contributing to previous GSoC projects&quot;&lt;/em&gt; he said. The horrors of implementing a linked list in C were fresh in my mind. I started learning Python. I remember a phone call when I said - &lt;em&gt;&quot;it just feels like a wrapper which is easy to understand, but isn&apos;t this just cheating? I don&apos;t understand C. I don&apos;t know programming&quot;&lt;/em&gt;. I was doing everything possible to sabotage my self-esteem and tell myself that I&apos;m a failure and can&apos;t write code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The night GSoC results came out, I changed. It felt like Open Source will resurrect my joy and meaning in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you have just read involves a lot of luck but also persistence. And still, only 0.01% make it this far with this speed. Think about all the students who didn&apos;t get proper coaching to study for IIT JEE. All the students in Tier 2, Tier 3 colleges who thought they can get good jobs just by attending classes and doing well in exams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our country is training students to pass exams and not really to get real world experience or acquire knowledge. This is no surprise, we&apos;ve known this for a while. However, now I feel nothing will change if we keep ranting and not do anything about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we&apos;re just thinking about all of this, there are &quot;influencers&quot; with millions of followers on YouTube and Instagram, telling batshit crazy things to students. With no professional experience, they are preparing an army of next generation of students in India - all driven by fear and fandom. This all came to light with the biggest fuck up in India&apos;s EdTech industry - Byju&apos;s, which made billions, cashing on the fear, doubt and uncertainty of Indian parents for their kids&apos; education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of five years in college, I spent countless hours trying to create more such stories like mine. In my first year, only 4 students were selected for GSoC. In my final year, the count was 32. Many went ahead to create their own projects that summer. In my first year, competitive coding and leetcode were the go-to ways to land a job. In my final year, there were companies taking direct interviews if you had done GSoC or had good Open Source projects in your resume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all happened due to a handful of us trying to teach Open Source, Git, GitHub, Python and most importantly, created an inclusive environment for anyone to be a hacker and take control of their destiny. One of those groups is still active after 10 years of existence, it&apos;s called &lt;a href=&quot;https://kossiitkgp.org/&quot;&gt;Kharagpur Open Source Society&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our flagship program &lt;a href=&quot;https://kwoc.kossiitkgp.org/&quot;&gt;Kharagpur Winter of Code&lt;/a&gt; is one of the finest ways to get young IIT students get started with Open Source. In the first year, we had 2500+ registration and 100s created their first meaningful Pull Request ever. I know few of them personally, some are really smart engineers and builders today, while some are pursuing higher education at esteemed institutions in US and Europe. In the following years, many other IITs and colleges started their own &quot;Winter of Code&quot; programs. The spark had ignited a fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, my work has taken me to different fields, with diverse people and cultures. These experiences have only deepened my pride in the unique and valuable communities I had experienced at IIT KGP and KOSS. Yet, I can‚Äôt ignore some challenges that persist even today. It&apos;s unsettling for me and I spend too much time thinking about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&apos;s so much to discuss and lots to learn. I realized there are many who feel this way and want a place to continue sharing their stories. The whole thing exploded with my latest blog post called &lt;a href=&quot;/2f4908a49fe85424343cffb8461d601f/why-dont-you-move-abroad.md&quot;&gt;Why Don&apos;t You Move Abroad?&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I invite you all to join me in these conversations. Let‚Äôs ask tough questions, share our experiences, and help those who might not have the clarity we now have. There are millions graduating every year who can benefit from our guidance and mentorship on the following topics -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open Source and its impact on career growth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Students frustrated with the Indian Education System - non-CSE, non-IIT/BITS/NIT, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Importance of Education and Science in life, especially teenage years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Living in India vs Abroad, fighting stereotypes and loneliness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building Products - understanding Sales and Marketing as Engineers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Storytelling and importance of meaningful relationships&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edit: This article reached the &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42191805&quot;&gt;front page of Hacker News&lt;/a&gt;. I am surprised to learn how the broader international community of young migrants relate with this as well. Many thanks - you got this!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just wrapped up a tech conference here this week in Salt Lake City. I was one of the speakers. It was a special moment for me. Strangely enough, the very first time I came to US, it was also as a speaker at a conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚ÄúDid you just say you are a speaker at this thing?‚Äù&lt;/em&gt;, asked the US Visa officer, before stamping a B1/B2 on my Passport for ten years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was 18 back then. The confusion made sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A decade has gone by. I got married, switched multiple jobs, wrote a lot of code, lived in three different continents, spoke at many conferences and made a lot of friends for life. I am now back living in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚ÄúDude, so when are you moving to the US?‚Äù,&lt;/em&gt; I frequently get asked by friends, colleagues and my well-wishers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚ÄúI‚Äôm not‚Äù.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My answer falls flat on most people. It‚Äôs as if, I‚Äôve just said, &lt;em&gt;‚ÄúI do not want more money and success.‚Äù&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this blog post I want to add more colors to my answer. Hope some of you relate with this, especially if you are someone like me considering your decision of moving abroad or moving back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But first, let me take you back to my teens when life was much simpler and Physics was my most favorite thing in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-iit-dream&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#the-iit-dream&quot; aria-label=&quot;the iit dream permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The IIT Dream&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like many Indians of my generation, I spent my childhood in a single bedroom rented house. Every evening, my brother and I would sit in front of a oil lamp (later battery lamp) and study maths and science. In the mornings, our &lt;em&gt;dada ji&lt;/em&gt; would teach us English and Hindi grammar. It was a household where two things were most valued - Education and Love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Education, because that seemed like the only way to escape generational poverty and not having to worry about, if there are enough candlesticks to last the week or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, Love because &lt;em&gt;familia is everything&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Millions of students in India prepare to get into IITs every year. With the proper amount of luck and improper amount of childhood sacrifices, I made it into IIT Kharagpur. And that changed everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the admission to engineering colleges, more than two thirds of students want to study Computer Science. This is what increases the chances of landing a job and what everyone seems to be doing. In my hostel room in Kota where I studied for 2 years of IIT prep, I had a note stuck on my wall which listed all the opening and closing ranks of all Computer Science branches in the 7 major IITs. When I saw the results and my rank, it was nowhere close to those CS cutoff ranks and I teared up as if I had failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And just like that, 99.99% of Indian students start their education journey by the system telling them that they are not worth it and they don‚Äôt even get to decide what they study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I couldn‚Äôt get into the Computer Science department, I knew what I wanted to study. My father has been a software engineer since the 90s and my brother is an absolute rockstar with computers. We didn‚Äôt have cartoons in TV back in our childhood but had our hands on keyboard ever since I could possibly remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I was ready to join IIT and say &lt;em&gt;‚ÄúFuck you,‚Äù&lt;/em&gt; to the education system, ‚Äú&lt;em&gt;I‚Äôm going to be the best programmer the world has ever seen.‚Äù&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;college-and-open-source&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#college-and-open-source&quot; aria-label=&quot;college and open source permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;College and Open Source&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was nowhere close to being the best programmer. I failed to implement a linked list in C in my first year. It was not going well. However, at the same time, I created my first Python package &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/morse-talk/morse-talk&quot;&gt;morse-talk&lt;/a&gt; and published on pypi.org. It was immediately used by a professor somewhere in Europe who forked it and made a lot of contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal of being the ‚Äúbest programmer‚Äù shifted to &quot;create value for others by writing code&quot;. That summer, only 4 students were selected in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code&quot;&gt;Google Summer of Code&lt;/a&gt; from my college. I was one of them, the only freshman. Two years of GSoC paid more than enough to cover my five years of college tuition fees. I found both value and meaning by doing Open Source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very quickly, people started referring me with my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/orkohunter&quot;&gt;GitHub handle&lt;/a&gt; OrkoHunter. I, among few of my good friends, established &lt;a href=&quot;https://kossiitkgp.org/&quot;&gt;Kharagpur Open Source Society&lt;/a&gt; to spread the culture of Open Source in campus. Though secretly, it was to give hope to the students who were defeated by the education system and told &lt;em&gt;‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt study Computer Science, because you didn‚Äôt know Carbon has a radioactive isotope.‚Äù&lt;/em&gt; In the first few years, we exclusively hired only non-CS students out of spite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was having a blast with the altruism that came with organizing Open Source workshops for students, helping them write their first useful Python application and making their first Pull Request. In 2017, we organized our first ever Open Source conference in college. We had about a thousand attendees, two days of talks, tutorials and lots of fun. We had full blown AV setup, speakers and attendees coming from multiple cities. We had a large budget too. I was leading it, being one of the three co-chairs of the conference. We were living the dream!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One night during the summit, I received an email from a recruiter at Twitter - &lt;em&gt;‚ÄúHey Himanshu, We saw your GitHub profile. Would you like to join us for an internship at Twitter San Francisco office in the Open Source team?‚Äù&lt;/em&gt;. I was so busy with the conference that I forgot to respond for 24 hours. She reached back - &lt;em&gt;‚ÄúHimanshu, are you interested?‚Äù&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Landing a foreign internship in college is one of those 0.1% things - it‚Äôs extremely rare. You need to practice a lot of leetcode, have excellent referrals and be a sports programmer ready to traverse a binary tree. I have never written a Binary Tree traversal in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My interviews were all around the projects I had open sourced by then. One being the most popular Python library for Graph Theory, the other being a package used to study X-ray data from black holes. I was working on much more important things. Learning how to traverse a Binary Tree for me was a waste of time - that‚Äôs how I saw it back then. I knew I will most likely never use it. Though I used to be maniacal about writing reusable code and ReactJS!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I applied for the J1 visa (short term work visa) and made my way to San Francisco. That summer in SF was probably the coldest summer I had ever. The internship paid extremely well and taught a lot of things about corporate Open Source. I worked upon setting up the &lt;a href=&quot;https://opensource.twitter.dev&quot;&gt;opensource.twitter.dev&lt;/a&gt; - something which still runs and publishes weekly reports of Twitter‚Äôs flagship open source projects. I‚Äôm pretty sure Elon Musk has seen the website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Career-wise, it was the best thing that could have happened to me. My manager from Twitter moved to Spotify later on who told me about the Backstage Open Source project, which led me to Harness leading the product built on top of Backstage. As Steve Jobs once said, &lt;em&gt;‚Äúyou will only be able to connect the dots looking backwards.‚Äù&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the thrilling career advancements that summer, I often wept myself to sleep at nights. The timezone difference between India and US west coast is about 12 hours. Which means, when you wake up, your family and friends are about to go to bed. And when you come back from office, your family has just woken up. Couple of hours is all you get to connect with anyone back home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, here‚Äôs the thing, I had lived alone before. For the IIT prep, I was in Kota for 2 years locked in my room and studying, visited home only two times during Diwalis. My college was in a remote village and far from home as well. But I had never felt that lonely, being on the other side of the world than home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am also not an introvert when it comes to talking to strangers. I was leading two student groups in college and fortunately made a lot of friends. It was easy for me to approach seniors, batch mates and juniors in college to build relationships. However, making friends in US was a completely different ballgame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money and Status was on everyone‚Äôs mind. All they talked about was Visas, dating, getting paid more and playing a different kind of game that I wanted to play. Not many &lt;em&gt;truly&lt;/em&gt; wanted to be a software engineer or cared about Software. While I found few who did and made a real attempt to know each other - the friendships I found in the US were very shallow. Back home, we called them acquaintances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all felt ‚Ä¶ like an unlivable place for commoners like me. Homelessness was at its peak. I am the guy, who likes to walk slow on the streets without a destination. But I was told on day one Twitter orientation to &lt;em&gt;‚ÄúWalk fast‚Äù&lt;/em&gt;. Drugged homeless people approached me, one guy tried to hit me while waiting to cross the street. I once went out to get some groceries and when making a turn, I saw a person holding a gun, hiding at the turn, waiting for someone. I had never seen a gun in my life till that point. It made me think - &lt;em&gt;‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm caught accidentally in a gun fight here, no amount of legal justice or candle marches would make my parents happy‚Äù.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I have a huge respect for San Francisco and the Bay Area. For me, it still is one of the most beautiful places on earth. Being an engineer as well as follower of Ram Dass and Timothy Leary, I thank the west for what it has given to world. One of the first Open Source license BSD, came from Berkley. The computer I am using to write this on, came from the valley. Silicon Valley is an absolutely historic place for a techie like me. I actually felt quiet emotional walking on the Haight-Ashbury street. The words ‚ÄúTurn On, Tune In and Drop out‚Äù echoed in my ears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the respect for the place and culture, I found myself struggling to become one with it. After spending 4 months there, I still had one year of college left. On my final day in US, I ate my last bagel sandwich in a cafe in Mission district and boarded my flight back to Kolkata. After 24 hours of flight and three hours of cab drive, I reached my hostel. One of my dear friends was waiting for me downstairs at 2AM. We hugged and I knew, I had arrived &lt;em&gt;home&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being an Indian student, it is almost impossible to get your first job in the US. Very rarely companies take the chance of picking you to go through H1B lottery, employers go for a safer choice. My manager at Twitter tried to get me a job, but after months of struggle, he gave up, and I had no job offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All IITs and most colleges have a ‚Äúplacement season‚Äù where companies fly in on campus and hire as many students as they can within a short period of time. It‚Äôs a flea market. Thousands of students show up in collared white shirts, blue pants and polished black shoes with resumes in their hands. Day 1 placement makes you a rockstar among your friends. If you are not placed by Day 10, you are essentially a loser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students get no choice of where they want to work at. If you pass their series of coding tests, panel discussions and what not - you are given one offer (if you are blessed then maybe 2-3 offers) and have to make the decision in an hour. No negotiation on what you will be doing, at what location or at what compensation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rebel in me found the system to be dehumanizing, especially for the Top 1% students of the country. As a result, I told myself that I will find a job elsewhere where I will have some idea on what I‚Äôll be working upon and with whom. I did not sign up for campus placements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine connected me with an employer in Tokyo. The product was Mercari US and the team was pretty diverse. It paid well and many of my friends were already going to Tokyo that year. I interviewed with the CTO, VP of Product and Engineering and my Engineering Manager, and I was in! Again, without traversing a binary tree. The job paid extremely well for a new grad like me. I was set to join them after I graduate. As they say, &lt;em&gt;when it rains, it pours&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;life-in-tokyo&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#life-in-tokyo&quot; aria-label=&quot;life in tokyo permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Life in Tokyo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was very excited to go to Japan. I found the country to be extremely calm and connected with the roots of human consciousness. It was people, people were hardworking but respectful of each other. Great customer service, free of crime and welcoming. Everyone was somehow aware. Everyone respected elderly and valued wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan and India only has a timezone difference of about 4 hours. There was plenty of time in the day for me to connect back to family and friends. I made friends there as well, actually a lot of them. I was sharing my apartment with a very good friend of mine from college. Life was amazing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work was great too. I distinctly remember my manager saying - &lt;em&gt;‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt seem like a fresher‚Äù&lt;/em&gt;. All because I have been writing real code for 5 years at that point and not traversing binary trees. I knew what a 12 factor app was and how to write effective Database queries that scales up to tens of thousands of daily active users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One fine day, I was talking to my ex-manager back from Twitter, who had just moved to Spotify. He told me about &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/backstage/backstage&quot;&gt;Backstage Open Source&lt;/a&gt;. It was released just a few days ago, on March 14, 2020. I have always dreamt about writing Open Source software while getting paid for it. He said, &lt;em&gt;‚ÄúHimanshu, just so you know, I would love to work with you again in a heartbeat, if I could.‚Äù&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend, I got two pull requests merged in the project. It had 50 GitHub stars back then and a few contributors. It is currently at about 30K stars with 1500+ contributors. Interviews happened with Spotify and I knew every single one of my interviewers. In one of those, we forgot to introduce ourselves as we have been talking back and forth on Discord on the same day. I made my way in. Spotify flew me Premium Economy to Stockholm, the land of Opeth and Zlatan Ibrahimovic. That‚Äôs all I knew about Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first summer in Stockholm was my best summer ever. The bar was already high by that point, but I absolutely enjoyed biking every weekend to play football, walking around the rivers, parks and nearby jungles. Stockholm is an interesting landscape, within 5 mins you can reach downtown, a river, a historic place or a cave - it‚Äôs all nearby, everything is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europe values work-life balance like no one else. I still believe if anyone wants to have fun in life and doesn&apos;t want to work too hard, get a job in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But back then, Covid was at its peak. It didn‚Äôt affect my life in Sweden who was one of the few countries to not implement ban on anything. However, I didn‚Äôt get to see enough of Europe or attended enough concerts as I had hoped for. I only got to travel in my last year, and it was already too late - the dark winters in Stockholm had taken a hit on me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two and half years passed by. I experienced the peak of my career. Got to be known as ‚ÄúThe Backstage Guy‚Äù in the Open Source community. I saw the team grew from 10 to 50 and onboarded many engineers, many of them were far more skilled and experienced than me. I had learned a lot at Spotify and is one of the best companies to be working for as an engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The timezone difference was not that different either. Again 4 hours and I was able to connect with my family and friends. I found some good friends back there as well. However, during that time, my grandmother passed away. This was the first time I had experienced death in my family. Someone I knew was no more in this world. I was not able to go back in time and mourn with family. Though I was not extremely attached to my grandma, it made me think - &lt;em&gt;what if I had lost someone else, someone far closer to me?&lt;/em&gt; It was also the time when I became a lot closer to my lovely childhood friend, who is now my wife. After many years, it made no sense to me to live far from her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all the European and work life glory, something was not working out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;you-know-you-can-come-back-right&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#you-know-you-can-come-back-right&quot; aria-label=&quot;you know you can come back right permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚ÄúYou know you can come back right?‚Äù&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One fine day, I was sitting in my living room. I had gained about 25 KGs of additional weight in the past year. It was three in the afternoon and the sun had already set. I was on a video call with my dad. We were talking about a few things, one of them being Russia‚Äôs invasion on Ukraine. He was quiet worried about the situations in Europe. I said Sweden had no bone in this fight so don‚Äôt worry about it. But then after the conversation, he was about to hang up, as mom had called for the evening tea. Just then, something hit me and I froze. &lt;em&gt;I was alone in this apartment, middle of nowhere. Why was I not there with them, having that cup of tea?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I broke. Tears streamed down my face and I had no words. What could I have said? That I am an incapable, grown man who can‚Äôt even live on his own? Someone who can‚Äôt move on from family? At that moment, I just wanted to hug my father, but I couldn‚Äôt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He kept asking - &lt;em&gt;What happened? Why are you crying? Are you not well?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silence. I had no words to explain what I was feeling. It was definitely the &lt;em&gt;Chai&lt;/em&gt;, now that I think about it. Us Indians, huh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After few minutes, he said something that unlocked a door in my perception that I had never opened. He said, &lt;em&gt;‚ÄúYou know you can always come back right? No one is forcing you to live there. You can have an amazing life back in India too.‚Äù&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I didn‚Äôt know this. I really did not know this! All I knew, was that you are supposed to move abroad when you grow up. Moving abroad is synonymous with being successful, filling up your bank account. It takes your career to the moon and gives you the highest level of status possible among your peers. I thought that was the only, most respectful way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very next day, I wrote an email to my General Manager that I am moving to India. Spotify didn‚Äôt permit engineers to work from India, so I knew this was not going to work out. But at that moment, I just wanted to go back home and hug my father - and no job or salary was going to stop me from doing that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, Spotify valued the work I was doing with Backstage and exceptionally permitted me to work from India. I was their first R&amp;#x26;D hire here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I had made the decision to move, I decided to update my friends about it. I put up a WhatsApp status and also made a post on LinkedIn. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6944645250938241024/&quot;&gt;My post went viral&lt;/a&gt; with 5 million views, 28,000 reactions and 900 comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My decision to move back was shocking to many. Many of my friends who lived abroad related to the challenges of loneliness and cultural shock with me. It was also post-Covid era, where many realized remote work is possible and being in the same location all the time is not needed. Startups were blooming, many of them hiring engineering exclusively in India. There was a mass reverse-brain drain happening in that moment, it still is happening, and I am very excited about it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I moved back home, starting living in Mumbai with my wife and family. I now get to spend time with my parents without having to plan my days and think about my international travels. Back then, any travel would be 2-4 weeks and there was no room to catchup with an old friend in a different city. I had missed so many reunions, marriages and family events. I now attend them all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mental health has now fully recovered. My physical health is coming along, long way to go still.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I work remotely at Harness as a Product Manager, the best job I could be doing right now. I fly to Bangalore every quarter to meet my team in person and spend a lot of time with my colleagues in the US over Zoom. I like working late, my most productive hours are 6-10PM. In childhood, this was the time after school where I would sit to study without any distractions. In college, this was the time after classes for club meetups, project discussions or just writing code. Even at work, my most important meetings happen in the evening. Some see it as a cost of living in India, for me this works just fine. Maybe things will change after having kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-why-dont-you-move-abroad-now&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#so-why-dont-you-move-abroad-now&quot; aria-label=&quot;so why dont you move abroad now permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;So, why don‚Äôt you move abroad now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think people should live where they are the happiest. Happiness sparks creativity and is responsible for overall success. Yes, moving to US increases my chances of professional career success, I‚Äôll get to be in proximity with people who have ideas and money to make the ideas come alive. But for me, it comes with significant emotional damage. For some people out there, this is a sacrifice worth making. This was a lot true 20 years ago. The internet age has changed everything. It is now possible to balance career, wealth and happiness while living in India as a techie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you move to the US with your wife? You‚Äôll have family and friends around.‚Äù&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me put it in a way which doesn‚Äôt offend people - very few of my friends in the US are my real friends. My best friends in US are all planning to move back. My other friends are stuck in the whirlwind of H1Bs and Green Card applications and coping up with their emotional challenges. I wish the best for all of them, but I do not enjoy that lifestyle - it reeks of captivity and not freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚ÄúIf you plan to start your own company, shouldn‚Äôt you move out of India?‚Äù&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes I do intend to create a company in the future. And yes, most likely the customers are going to be in the west. However, I have seen enough companies with India based founders that I have full confidence I do not have to move personally to make the company successful. I‚Äôll travel frequently and stay up late - which I already do in some sense. We live in a global internet-enabled world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs also not that easy. Visas make it extremely hard for Indians to start a company in the US. The whole process makes me want to puke. The Government and popular opinion seems to be heading in an opposite direction. The dehumanizing experience is similar to my take on campus placements in college above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you move temporarily for a few years?‚Äù&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe for 3 months, yes. Moving for 2 years is a slippery slope of accepting the emotional damage which I will cause to myself and my wife. The drug called monthly salary will keep adding band-aids to the damage and it will again be too late before I realize the repercussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt move, it will affect your career.‚Äù&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, success is both the professional success and emotional wellbeing. I am willing to sacrifice some of my professional success for the other. We all have one life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-vision-for-india&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#my-vision-for-india&quot; aria-label=&quot;my vision for india permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;My vision for India&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Richard Feynman says - &lt;em&gt;you are not nameless to yourself, your family and the surrounding ones.&lt;/em&gt; When I was 17 in college, my first meaning of life came from doing Open Source and helping others realize that they have much more in them - much more than what the system and society says about them. I uplifted many and showed alternate ways to do well in life. At least, for a few dozen people. A path which did not include Grades and meaningless competitive code grinding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think 21st century is a fantastic time to be in a developing nation like India, especially among the tech-enabled hard-working Indians that I know of. I have a lot of hope for my generation. I plan to write more on this in a separate post, when I find time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope you enjoyed reading through this. If at any point, I have hurt your sentiments, I would like to apologize. This is me expressing my own personal views on this very controversial and emotional topic. I still advise people to choose what‚Äôs best for them, moving abroad is a great option for many who do not carry emotional baggage like me. We all have one life, and we all should do what‚Äôs best for us and our loved ones. Peace.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[You need a Product Mindset]]></title><description><![CDATA[Treat Your Developers Like VIP Customers Your developers are not just users; they're customers who have high expectations from your internal‚Ä¶]]></description><link>https://orkohunter.net/blog/you-need-a-product-mindset</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://orkohunter.net/blog/you-need-a-product-mindset</guid><pubDate>Sat, 23 Sep 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span

&lt;p&gt;Your developers are not just users; they&apos;re customers who have high expectations from your internal developer platform. Comprising a blend of in-house and third-party tools, this platform is essential for your developers to deliver top-notch software products. The takeaway? Treat your internal platform like a product, not just a service. Let&apos;s dive into the &quot;how&quot; and &quot;why.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;product-managers-are-crucial-to-platform-engineering&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#product-managers-are-crucial-to-platform-engineering&quot; aria-label=&quot;product managers are crucial to platform engineering permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Product Managers are Crucial to Platform Engineering&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Happens When You Think Like a Product Manager?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You solve real problems your developers face.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You actively collect and listen to feedback.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You define KPIs and keep an eye on adoption rates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You forge meaningful relationships to enhance the developer experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sound familiar? Companies with excellent engineering cultures are already doing this. If you‚Äôre not, it‚Äôs high time to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Actionable Tip&lt;/strong&gt;: Consider hiring a Product Manager focused solely on &quot;Developer Effectiveness.&quot; This role could be a game-changer for both new and experienced engineers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key responsibilities that you should expect from this role&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deep understanding of the engineering culture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gathering feedback from developers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building action oriented roadmap of your platform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Directly responsible for platform tools like Internal Developer Portal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building consensus among platform providers on best practices and tools of choice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create Golden Paths for new joiners&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The platform org at Spotify runs a Customer Advisory Board (CAB) every year for their internal customers i.e. developers. This is a day when all platform product managers and stakeholders gather in front of dozens of developers and allow them to yell about their problems. Well not exactly but you get the idea. It results in murals of problems and ideas which they take back to platform engineers who implement them. I was one of them. :)
Not every company runs a CAB for their external customers. Doing it for internal platform users is a sign of how strong of an engineering culture you have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a great organization, both internal and external customers are almost indistinguishable&lt;/strong&gt;. Just like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/brief-history-platform-engineering-himanshu-mishra/&quot;&gt;Mr Bezos had mandated&lt;/a&gt; in early 2000s for Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three Ways to Measure Platform Health&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Formal feedback via surveys and in-app mechanisms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Informal feedback loops with platform engineers and product managers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data-driven approaches, like DORA metrics and tools like Software Engineering Insights&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Actionable Tip&lt;/strong&gt;: Conduct a biannual developer survey to identify bottlenecks and rate overall satisfaction.
Ask them to rate their experience with internal tools and overall satisfaction with the internal platform. Ask them how easy it is for them to find information internally like services, APIs and documentation. Ask them where they spend their most time being blocked on other people or processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hackathons are not just coding marathons; they&apos;re your innovation playground. Encourage engineers to ideate and create; you&apos;ll be surprised at the brilliant internal tools and solutions that emerge. After all your customers are hackers who take pride in solving problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Staff Up: Hire roles that focus on Developer Effectiveness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify Pain Points: What slows down your developers?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implement Feedback Loops: Consider setting up a Customer Advisory Board or dedicated channels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set KPIs: Metrics to measure adoption and success are crucial.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organize Hackdays: Let your developers be the problem-solvers they naturally are.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember the day I heard the word &lt;strong&gt;microservices&lt;/strong&gt; for the first time. For a while, I did not know what it truly meant. But it was a very hot topic, popping up in every conference and on everyone&apos;s slides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was 2015, Kubernetes had just been open sourced. Several companies had taken a leap of faith and started their year-long migrations, ditching SRE-managed monolithic server farms and adopting cloud native architectures. Most of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://thinkinsights.net/strategy/crossing-the-chasm/&quot;&gt;early adopters&lt;/a&gt; had already made this move by the time I got to be an insider at Twitter, Spotify and Mercari.&lt;/p&gt;

Correlation of Microservice and Kubernetes. Source: Google Trends&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However the seeds of this trend were planted long before in the history of software development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day in 2002, Jeff Bezos sent out a &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/chitchcock/1281611&quot;&gt;mandate&lt;/a&gt; to all the teams. It was a visionary yet strong idea to force all the internal services to communicate with each other via APIs. They were to assume that all services can be externalized in near future. This directive shattered traditional silos within the organization and emphasized treating both internal and external customers with equal importance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seemingly simple shift in mindset laid the foundation for a monumental transformation that was yet to come. Four years later in 2006, Amazon launched AWS and shaped the cloud as we know today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As cloud computing gained momentum, the need for efficient orchestration and management of applications across diverse environments became evident. Enter Kubernetes, an open-source container orchestration platform initially developed by Google. Kubernetes provided the tools to deploy, scale, and manage applications seamlessly, regardless of the underlying infrastructure. Its rise marked a shift towards cloud-native technologies and microservices-based architectures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these advancements brought unforseen agility for the teams, they also introduced new challenges. Developers, once focused primarily on coding, now find themselves responsible for the entire software delivery lifecycle end-to-end. From designing and developing to deploying, scaling, and maintaining applications, their role expanded significantly. This transition demanded a solution that could streamline these intricate processes and enable developers to concentrate on what they do best‚Äîinnovating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognizing the need to alleviate the growing complexity faced by developers, the concept of platform engineering emerged. Platform engineering entails creating an internal developer platform‚Äîa set of internal (and external) tools, services, and best practices that simplify the end-to-end software development process. This platform equips developers with the resources they need to build, test, deploy, and manage applications efficiently, while abstracting away much of the underlying infrastructure complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By providing a standardized environment, automation capabilities, and reusable components, platform engineering empowers developers to focus on coding and business logic rather than grappling with deployment intricacies or operational concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;A brief history of Backstage, another CNCF project among the ranks of Kubernetes and cloud native technologies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is an &quot;Internal Developer Portal&quot; and how it is the backbone of any platform org in a company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Current state of developer portals and the use-cases&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are building a software to be used by developers, you can not ignore extensibility. It needs to have a way of writing extensions/plugins/apps to extend the product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that is true for almost all of the softwares we use. It‚Äôs true if you really think about it. Think of all the things developers use today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs start with more common examples. Smartphones and Computers. There were some good phones in 2007 but iPhone came and disrupted the market. What was so unique about it? It introduced the possibility of &quot;writing apps for phones&quot;. And anyone could write them. We now have several billion dollar companies which are technically just apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If iPhone was a batteries included phone, with Apple responsible for creating all the modern apps people use, we wouldn‚Äôt be here today. Same goes for all operating systems like Linux, macOS and Windows. They are all platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What‚Äôs the next big thing a developer uses? Probably a browser. Even there, you can build chrome extensions, firefox plugins and what not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not to forget some of the most popular websites in the world like youtube, facebook, amazon, twitter, spotify, etc. are conventionally platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&apos;s next on a developer&apos;s minds? GitHub, Gitlab, etc. to host source code? You can build apps and integrations on them. It has it&apos;s own marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You use VSCode, vim, emacs etc. to write code? People have been building plugins for them for more than 30 years. They have a marketplace too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you use Slack to communicate? You can build integrations and apps that run on Slack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iTerm2 as terminal? zsh as shell? Plugins, plugins, plugins everywhere!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you analyze your entire tech stack, you will be surprised how many of them support writing plugins. From your database to your CI provider. From Kubernetes to Docker. From Figma to a Raspberry pi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if any of these products are open source, you can do more than just extending them. You can technically change them from their very core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why is that? Why did iPhones kicked the Motorola-s out of the market? Why would someone prefer a platform where they have to do extra work themselves over choosing an all-inclusive but closed product? The answer varies subjectively with people. To me, it‚Äôs the power that comes with open collaboration. You get more people building great things and sharing with each other, beyond the boundaries of a company or an org. Luckily open source has taught us similar lessons in the past 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To sum it up, there is no one-size-fits-all solution for developers. They love the unique culture in their teams and cherish them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don‚Äôt already know about &lt;a href=&quot;https://backstage.io&quot;&gt;Backstage&lt;/a&gt;, it‚Äôs an open platform for building developer portals in your company. It‚Äôs an open source project incubating at CNCF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href=&quot;https://internaldeveloperplatform.org/what-is-an-internal-developer-platform/#developer-portal-service-catalog-ui-api-or-cli&quot;&gt;internal developer portal&lt;/a&gt; is something that looks different at each company and has different use-cases. For some, it‚Äôs the developer&apos;s go-to hub for anything and everything. For some, it‚Äôs their entire catalog of the internal software ecosystem. For some, it‚Äôs their place to read and explore technical documentation. Or a place to launch new software components in the company. And many, many more such use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spotify has over 200 plugins inside their Backstage instance to enable additional use cases like A/B testing, user management, inner source, data pipelines, monitoring, deployment tracker and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these Backstage plugins inside a company are not built by their core maintainers team - it is federated and built by the experts in their domain. And it kind of makes sense. The ML/AI folks should decide and build what the rest of ML/AL engineers in the company should be using. The data folks should design the data hub and not those three full stack engineers maintaining the portal. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://backstage.io/plugins&quot;&gt;Open Source marketplace&lt;/a&gt; for Backstage has hundreds of plugins built by different companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, these plugins inside your Backstage-powered developer portal not only come from open source, but you have full power to write your own ones. Do you have an in-house way of managing users? No worries, write that plugin. Do you have an in-house way to measure software performance metrics? No worries, write that plugin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, Backstage is your developer portal. Why not bend it to fit your existing engineering culture, rather than changing your culture to fit how a software works.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Aldous Huxley's world of perceptions]]></title><description><![CDATA[You may already know of this novel called 1984, and its author George Orwell.

Aldous Huxley wrote a dystopian classic called Brave New World, which is contemporary to 1984 and has a similar literary significance. Although Huxley is slightly less familiar, I have come to realize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Huxley and Orwell talked about dyspotian futures. Although the path leading up to their fearful vision of world were treaded from different ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no-one who wanted to read one.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egotism.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;In 1984, people are controlled by inflicting pain. In Brave New World, they are controlled by inflicting pleasure.&quot;, writes Neil Postman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading this with the context of Social Media and News in our present world, we are so much closer to the world Huxley envisioned almost hundred years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this blog post isn&apos;t about dystopia. I want to talk a bit about this other masterpiece Huxley wrote called &quot;The Doors of Perception&quot;. It is a tiny book, just about 30 pages; but is top shelf for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-doors-of-perception&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#the-doors-of-perception&quot; aria-label=&quot;the doors of perception permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Doors of Perception&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huxley says that no two human beings have the same perception of the world. We perceive things around us uniquely. For example, it doesn&apos;t matter how close we feel to a person, let it be our partner, a close friend of ours or our parents - each of our perceptions will always be different. And it gets interesting if you think more about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We live together, we act on, and react to, one another; but always and in all circumstances we are
by ourselves. The martyrs go hand in hand into the arena; they are crucified alone. Embraced, the lovers desperately try to fuse their insulated ecstasies into a single self-transcendence; in vain. By its very nature every embodied spirit is doomed to suffer and enjoy in solitude. Sensations, feelings, insights, fancies - all these are private and, except through symbols and at second hand, incommunicable. We can pool information about experiences, but never the experiences themselves. From family to nation, every human group is a society of island universes...&quot;, says Huxley in this book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;reality&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#reality&quot; aria-label=&quot;reality permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Reality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If someone asks me - what do you mean by reality? I&apos;ll say, well, you know the trees grow, flowers bloom, we live on planet Earth, which is round, human beings experience pain and suffering, gravity exists - and the other things that I see in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my answer, I only mentioned what is easy for me to say, and can be agreed upon by a lot of people - hopefully everyone. But my complete reality is much larger and has edges which get a bit fuzzier. And I have not grown enough to describe them well, I think. I probably never will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;What we ordinarily call &quot;reality&quot; is merely that slice of total fact which our biological equipment, our linguistic heritage and our social conventions of thought and feeling make it possible for us to apprehend.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These words of Huxley are painful to read at times. He basically suggests that we&apos;ll never know the &lt;em&gt;absolute reality&lt;/em&gt; even if it exists. The tool that helps us cut this &quot;slice&quot; is called Perception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the good news is that our perceptions change, or rather expand. And we get to see more of it as we grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;experiences&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#experiences&quot; aria-label=&quot;experiences permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Experiences&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huxley says that for each of us, there are many perceptions which we can not access. Their doors are locked for us. For example, if you never given birth, you can still talk about parenting but there is so much more still locked for you. And you&apos;ll get to unlock that &lt;em&gt;door&lt;/em&gt; only when you will raise a child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He says that we are caged inside our perceptions, and that there are doors which lead us to new realities. But so far we have opened only a handful of them. And majority of doors are still locked for us - and that too from outside - so it&apos;s not possible for us to go and see what&apos;s on the other side merely by &lt;em&gt;thinking&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes experiences - or rather &quot;meaningful experiences&quot; to unlock these doors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My university campus was beautiful. The trees and the shades of green always blew my mind. Taking frequent walks in the day was one of my favorite activities. For a few years, I thought everyone around me knew it - just because it was obvious for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading Huxley and The Doors of Perception, I entered a brief but gloomy phase in life. He basically gave me some uncomfortable realizations that I had to live with. No matter how much I love my parents or my partner, they will never get to know it all. A part of me was getting sadder with more experiences I was having one by one. And it was getting harder for me to communicate &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; I felt. I was naive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years have passed and I have made peace with this limitation of life. We can not communicate everything, but we can try! Since then, I started putting more effort into the ways I communicate. Sometimes I speak, write poems, draw analogies from stories - and sometimes I would just send someone a song. I have made peace with the fact that everything can not be conveyed with language. Some things need to be heard, seen and felt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same goes for taking pictures. Don&apos;t get me wrong - I think photos are a great way of communicating. But sometimes I respect a view, by not taking a picture. How would you feel if someone took a favorite song of yours, and sang it poorly and offbeat? The same goes for me when I try to capture extraordinary beauty of nature in pixels. It usually happens with mountains, forests, oceans, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;art-is-an-attempt-to-communicate&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#art-is-an-attempt-to-communicate&quot; aria-label=&quot;art is an attempt to communicate permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Art is an attempt to communicate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Art (poetry, music, paintings etc.) are beautiful attempts by human beings to convey their perceptions. Even though I will never get to think about music, the way David Gilmour of Pink Floyd did. I will never get to think about world, the way Aldous Huxley did. I will never look at the stars in the sky, the way Van Gogh did. But their music, writings and paintings hints me of a larger reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realizing that the true nature of reality is beyond our comprehension and that we&apos;ll always be cutting slices of it, can be a humbling feeling. It can inspire us to keep expanding our perceptions - by have more meaningful experiences in life.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Naval Ravikant on JRE]]></title><description><![CDATA[Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qHkcs3kG44

(Lots and lots of wisdom here. And it&apos;s easy to listen to him.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specialization is for insects. You&apos;ve got one life to do all you want to do. Humans are multi-variant.
Every human is capable of all the experiences. We will have to dare to look fool if we want to start
over in something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Modern Struggle&quot; is no longer the disease of scarcity, but it&apos;s a disease of abundance.
On one side there are scientists, researchers, billions of dollars of creating addiction machines (Media, Technology, Food) vs You.
And you are alone in this fight. A short clip here with sketches from After Skool &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqlfWDyS1Io&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqlfWDyS1Io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would rather read 100 books over and over again, rather than read all the books. We have a finite memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been automating and eliminating jobs since forever (like when Electricity was invented). We don&apos;t lose jobs,
we start doing only the most creative jobs. The ideal world is where there are only &lt;em&gt;creative&lt;/em&gt; jobs, and all non-creative
jobs will be automated by machines. e.g. Identifying problems and thinking about solutions in a specialized field is a
creative job. Making art is a creative job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meditation is really doing &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt;. It&apos;s not about focusing on the breath, that&apos;s just the method which leads to the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happiness is peace in motion. When you are peaceful, it&apos;s easy for you to start doing things and be happy. Short notes from himself. &lt;a href=&quot;https://nav.al/peace-motion&quot;&gt;https://nav.al/peace-motion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You want to be healthy, happy and rich. (Words have more deeper meanings from his point of view.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One desire at a time. Desires are fine, but we can&apos;t fulfil more than one at a time. Is my posture correct, can I eat something now, what about the view, that message, this conversation, etc. etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True curiosity is when you want to learn it and you&apos;re not thinking about telling about it to people just that very moment. Good question to ask self: ‚ÄúWould I be still interested in this thing if I couldn‚Äôt tell anyone?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do things you love. Same philosophy as what Steve Jobs said in his Stanford commencement speech. If you don&apos;t love the 8 hours work you do every day, that&apos;s a huge waste of time in exchange of whatever money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;What gets you motivated to things these days?&quot;
&quot;Art. This is art, talking to you. Art is just creativity, anything that gets done for its own sake. There&apos;s nothing beyond it. Loving somebody, playing. Learning.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Why should one do Open Source in college?]]></title><description><![CDATA[More and more students are now being involved with Open Source programming.

Thanks to programs like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code&quot;&gt;Google Summer of Code&lt;/a&gt; who have seriously changed the lives of many and introduced hundreds of thousands of young students to Open Source programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this number is small in the grand scheme of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I have to make a guess, out of all the students who graduate and start their career around Software (including Data Science, Machine Learning, etc.), less than 10% would ever contribute to any Open Source projects. And even less would do so for an extended period of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, I am writing down some reflections. I am highlighting few major reasons why I feel open source contributions are helpful. And the benefits are extraordinary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;you-learn-so-much-more&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#you-learn-so-much-more&quot; aria-label=&quot;you learn so much more permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;You learn so much more&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost all of your Pull Requests will be reviewed by other people. In a healthy open source community, maintainers spend a big chunk of their time reviewing incoming Pull Requests. There are many times when review comments leave me in awe - and I am filled with gratitude. The reviewer wants to have good quality code in the software, but in effect of that, you learn so much more from their insights and experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally, this is one of the those experiences you may get in your internships and first few jobs. But what are the chances of you ending up in such a team? And even if you get one helpful mentor, that&apos;s just one. If you stay in Open Source communities, you are constantly learning from numerous of those, and not just in summer for a period of three months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our ways of doing software are heavily biased on the first projects we get involved with. We copy over the ideas to the future, since we know they have worked well. Exposure to multiple Open Source projects break that bias, and exposes us to other newer ways of creating Software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have seen many issues on GitHub describing a problem that seems extremely hard to solve. And when GitHub says, &lt;em&gt;this issue got closed by this specific Pull Request&lt;/em&gt; - I feel spoiled that I get to see what that Pull Request did. To have public access to such knowledge is a gift to this community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everyone studies Computer Science in college. And even if they do, their Software Engineering courses are either missing or outdated to the current day and age. MIT launched a course called - &lt;a href=&quot;https://missing.csail.mit.edu/&quot;&gt;&quot;The Missing Semester of Your CS Education&quot;&lt;/a&gt; to address this problem. Computer Science and Software Engineering have grown so much now, that it&apos;s impossible to teach both of them in a single curriculum. And the subjects have diverged - It has become Theory vs Practicality, Research vs Industry. Not all but most CS Professors are much closer to the research than the industry, and they expect students to do Open Source projects and internships on their own to gain the industry experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, a vast majority of Open Source work is done remote, over the internet, with strangers. The skills required to carry on a remote work become fundamental necessities - good written communication is one of many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;you-escape-the-privilege-barrier&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#you-escape-the-privilege-barrier&quot; aria-label=&quot;you escape the privilege barrier permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;You escape the privilege barrier&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In India, more than a million students graduate engineering courses &lt;em&gt;every year&lt;/em&gt;. Every other job extended in my college placement season was somehow related to programming. This number gets higher with the several tiers of colleges. I imagine an average good Software Company would get a headcount of 10 new-grad engineers, to hire from the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These numbers break my heart. Not everyone gets the chance to experience joy and growth in their career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open Source is small but a beam of hope for these students. Google Summer of Code doesn&apos;t look at your IIT JEE rank for you to participate in it. Maintainers don&apos;t look at what Department or college you study in, before answering your questions. All these nonsensical privilege barriers do not exist in your way to improve yourself and learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;you-become-a-volunteer&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#you-become-a-volunteer&quot; aria-label=&quot;you become a volunteer permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;You become a volunteer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open Source contribution was my first exposure of volunteering and belongingness to a community. Not everything needs to be paid in money. I started seeing the return value in terms of learning, joy of accomplishing something, or just doing something together with people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was part of a college group which helps college students learn more about Open Source. Looking back, I see that a lot of Open Source contributors follow the idea that - &lt;em&gt;Knowledge should be shared&lt;/em&gt;. They start helping out people for no apparent reasons. Well mainly because someone else helped them in their journey and they want to continue the tradition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This feeling of volunteering (somewhat altruism) in Open Source still impresses me and others. The idea of non-monetary benefits in work is strange to a majority of people I have met professionally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might already know that college admission exams are highly competitive. One wants to get into the best college. One wants to study in the best department. One wants to score the highest grades. One wants to get Gold medals in the online competitive events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It easily gets toxic for some people. It changes the perception of their social life. Even when talking to friends, they think of things they know more of - due to their performances in previous competitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&apos;t seen that much competition when it comes to Open Source contributions. People help each other a lot more than trying to get ahead in some kind of race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman&quot;&gt;Richard Feynman&lt;/a&gt; has said - &lt;em&gt;&quot;If you find science boring, you&apos;re learning it from a wrong teacher.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel the same for programming. Students may not like the complexity of a doubly linked list written in C, but might enjoy Python&apos;s 10 lines of code for their web server. Sure a lot of people like writing Software, but not everyone &lt;em&gt;&quot;loves&quot;&lt;/em&gt; to do it for their career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast of only working with a handful of internship projects, working on many well designed Open Source software increase our chances of falling in love with it. And it helps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my last blog post about &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/spotify/&quot;&gt;Joining Spotify in Sweden&lt;/a&gt;, I wrote a bit about this. Here, I have written more about what living asynchronously means to me. I have put some concrete examples from life where I have used this philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;define-asynchronous&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#define-asynchronous&quot; aria-label=&quot;define asynchronous permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Define Asynchronous&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have understood Asynchronous in programming but &lt;a href=&quot;%5Bhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchrony%5D(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchrony)&quot;&gt;Asynchrony&lt;/a&gt; has more (similiar) meanings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my earliest days with Javascript, I remember being stuck one time. In my program I was doing an API request. Irrespective of whether the request was successful, my variable to store the API response was always &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt;. I was in my first year of college and I expressed my frustration to my brother with &lt;em&gt;&quot;Javascript sucks&quot;&lt;/em&gt;. All he said was &lt;em&gt;&quot;Remember, Javascript is asynchronous.&quot;&lt;/em&gt; And that fixed the issue! I still see such problems and they get fixed by the &lt;em&gt;Remember...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the beginners face this problem with Javascript in their early days because Javascript is async in nature. This is unlike Python, which is a imperative (procedural) language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;difference&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#difference&quot; aria-label=&quot;difference permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Difference&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us take this short example of a program to understand the difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;
1. Say &quot;Hello World&quot;.
2. *API request to fetch an image from the internet.
3. Based on the response of the request, store the image.
4. Calculate 1 + 1.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a procedural language like Python or C/C++, all the 4 lines will be executed one after the other. The lines 3 and 4 will be executed only when line 2 has completely finished (network request has completed). But, it could take a second or more to complete that request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our program will spend most of its time at line 2 waiting for the network request to finish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, in an asynchronous language like Javascript, we will write the program differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;
1. Say &quot;Hello World&quot;.
2. *API request to fetch an image from the internet.
3.              (Callback) Based on the response of the network request, store the image.
4. Calculate 1 + 1.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, line 1 will be executed as usual. In line 2, we will do the API request. But, this time we are not going to wait around for the response. We will immediately move on to Line 4 and execute it. When the network call in line 2 finishes, we will execute the &quot;callback&quot; assigned to it in line 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#conclusion&quot; aria-label=&quot;conclusion permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Asynchronous programming comes into the picture for the blocks of code which take significant time to execute i.e. something which blocks the procedural execution of the main program.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sending an internet request, reading/writing to a file or a database takes way more time than calculating 1 + 1. So, we write a &quot;callback function&quot; for our asynchronous block of code. The callback decides what to do when the network request or the I/O operation completes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise&quot;&gt;Promise in Javascript&lt;/a&gt; has the same philosophy and is more powerful than callbacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-philosophy&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#the-philosophy&quot; aria-label=&quot;the philosophy permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Philosophy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans and computers function in an extraordinarily similar fashion. The I/O (Input/Output) operation for a computer is to talk to other computers. The I/O operation for us is to talk to other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blocks the main program. It means there is a chunk of time that it takes away from the main program for as long as the blocking execution is being done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These I/O operations are necessary for us to survive and communicate. They happen frequently and are also time-consuming. It then becomes important for us to manage them well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Living Asynchronously is us making sure our I/O operations are asynchronous most of the time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember in my school, our Maths textbooks used to have many questions in the form of exercises. An exercise was a collection of questions on one topic. There used to be dozens of chapters and hundreds of exercises in a book. The year-long school curriculum and timeline were to make sure all the chapters and their exercises get completed by the students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, the entire batch of students is synchronised on what exercise they are doing. Let&apos;s say the teacher decides that this week, we are going to complete the Exercise 21 based on the basic Trigonometric formulae. By Monday next week, It is expected of the students to have their notebooks up-to-date. That&apos;s how synchronous programming works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This model is not great. Not everyone in the class needs to follow the pace set by the teacher for what they deem is suitable for the class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was in the 3rd standard (age 7), my father started teaching Maths to my elder brother and me. (Fun fact: All three of us now do programming for a living!). It was 2004. In the summer before the school would begin, dad had set the target for me to solve all the problems in the book I was going to study that year. I loved the experience! Although it took a lot of time from my summer vacation, it was rewarding. And I didn&apos;t want to stop there. Dad noticed this and bought me the maths textbooks for the following years. And this went on until in the 7th standard, I was doing the problems of the Maths book used in the 10th class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had followed the synchronous philosophy of the school, I would have to sit around throughout the year, learning not much new. A decade after that time, I would consciously start living asynchronously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in college, for five years I was part of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.metakgp.org/w/Technology_Literary_Society&quot;&gt;literary society&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kossiitkgp&quot;&gt;a club&lt;/a&gt; to promote open source. These were two separate groups and I was an active member of both! In my 3rd/4th year, I was part of the so called &quot;executive batch&quot;. We were 4-5 people responsible to execute the events organized by 30-50 of us members, for the hundreds of students on campus to attend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we organized any event (a poetry night, an open mic, a Python or a GSoC workshop, etc.), I as the organizer needed to sync with all the members helping out. There are many operations that need to be taken care of, like logistics, publicity, poster distribution, members&apos; performances/talks, communication with external members, finances, etc. If I remember correctly, I had burnt out early in the year. I had to sync with so many people during the days of the actual event. I valued the event&apos;s success not much by its attendance, but a lot by how we did it and the things we learned in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets take the task of poster distribution. The job was to print a bunch of posters for the event that had its details, description, contact, venue, time, etc. and paste it across the college campus so that other students would notice. From the team, I would assign one person to take care of this. This meant that they were responsible for going to the printing press, getting the copies done, and then with the help of other members, putting them up across the campus. Given I had other equally important tasks to take care of, it was a nightmare to contact all the people involved in this particular task. But, I couldn&apos;t just &quot;assign and forget&quot; the task to someone because, if he or she decided to slack off, it would disrupt the event. This has happened quite many times as I remember. So, I started identifying people I could trust, who shared the passion of the work and cared. And then, living asynchronously was easy and the only sane way to go about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Then on, all my instructions and tasks had their &lt;em&gt;callbacks&lt;/em&gt;. And if someone else asked me to do something, I would ask them to write their &lt;em&gt;callback&lt;/em&gt; i.e. tell me what to do when I&apos;m done with this. I reduced many unnecessary &quot;blocking&quot; I/O operations from my life, resulting in a much relaxed life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many years ago Facebook started showing things like &quot;message seen at 10:10 AM&quot; in their chatbox. This was the first time I saw something like this. Earlier, messaging someone was much like sending a very short email - you didn&apos;t expect a response within a minute. Instant communication started catching up and now there is a product called &quot;mail tracker&quot; which tells you when and how many times your email was read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have disabled the blue seen tick in WhatsApp and I have a &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/delete-facebook/&quot;&gt;dummy facebook account&lt;/a&gt;. This means, I don&apos;t get to know when my message was read and the other person doesn&apos;t know when I read their message. This is me, trying to reduce &quot;synchronous&quot; communication from life, as it introduces more problems than it solves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If someone &lt;em&gt;sees&lt;/em&gt; my message, I never ought to expect an instant response. I have no idea what they are doing in their &quot;main program&quot;. They could be in a thought process, talking with someone else, working on something, or be in one of a thousand different possibilities. So &quot;seen at 10:10 AM&quot; gives me no information. It instead triggers me to think - &lt;em&gt;why have they not replied yet&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I want to have a synchronous conversation, I would set up a call at the convenience of both of us. That is much efficient in every aspect. By not having to worry about replying instantly and not expecting someone to do so, I have freed a lot of time that I used to waste in waiting for the response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I have the freedom of my thoughts, asynchrony is associated with freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If our actions and words demand synchronous response from the other person, it directly impacts their time. It affects how they want to spend it. Doing it way often is not nice. And it is a kind gesture to respect their time and do less synchronous communication. Allowing someone to be free is a great expression of love and it makes us better humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would be crazy to say that all synchronous communications are bad. That would be insane. What I do is reduce the frequency, and increase the time to generate more value. And of course, do lots of async stuff. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A blog post is a shining example of communicating asynchronously in this world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog post does not demand anything from you. You can close it as soon as you opened it, read it now, a week later or next year. I have no expectation of knowing whether you read it or not, unless you want to let me know. I enjoy writing and reading them. They do not feel &quot;instant&quot;. They do not say &quot;just now&quot; or &quot;posted a minute ago&quot;. As Quincy Larson says - all notifications are synchronous. Social media wants to notify me if someone has said something publicly. Facebook/Instagram/Twitter wants to keep me in &quot;sync&quot; with what all my friends are doing. However, this blog post will sit here on this website. And if someone wants to see if I have written something new, it will be discovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; going to tweet a link to this blog post. That will be synchronous. Oh, the hippocracy! ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before my first job started, I was convinced that by introducing more asynchrony in life, I am saving my time and energy and I am being happier. When I started working, I had the challenge of adopting the same philosophy at work. I knew it would be challenging because people have their own style of working. But I tried my best to keep this philosophy alive with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I would have technical queries to ask, most of them would be Email or Slack and few in-person. As I understood the team and the technologies better over time, I would change all my questions to being asynchronous. That kept everyone involved a bit happier. The person who&apos;d write the answer, would do so in their free time. Hence the responses had more details and helped me more than what a disrupting synchronous question would have done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a project is newborn, synchronous communication between the stakeholders and engineers is necessary and valuable. They help avoid confusion and misunderstandings. But as the tasks start being granular, sync-meetings begin losing their value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a project has grown large and has no documentation, there is no way asynchronous communication is possible even after months or years. The few people who created it, are going to waste more time answering questions, which they should have written in the form of documentation ages ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, product managers love to talk about projects in team meetings. Why won&apos;t they? They have a vision and want to share. But a wise engineering manager would come and ask, &quot;Can this information be shared via an email?&quot;. This is a smart question to ask each time because it not only promotes written documentation but saves time for the involved engineers. They got time to focus and pay more attention to the work, which would have been disrupted by a synchronous meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to blog posts, Documentation of projects and code is a light beam of hope in the asynchronous life. If I can find the documentation to read, it drastically reduces the amount of synchronous communication involved to solve my problem. And since a tap on the shoulder in not possible when working remotely, more written communication is the way to go!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Living Asynchronously is inspired by the concept of asynchronous programming and Javascript&apos;s callbacks and promises. Synchronous life events are blocking in nature, are inefficient and time-consuming. It is not always possible, but living asynchronous life has its benefits and is a great way to live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe this philosophy is easy to understand and can be applied on many aspects of life. I encourage you to think on your own and identify the synchronous events in life. And then imagine how living asynchronously would feel.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Letter with no subject]]></title><description><![CDATA[:name-retracted: wrote - Hi Himanshu, Congratulations from the bottom of my heart for joining Spotify.

&lt;p&gt;Hi Himanshu,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations from the bottom of my heart for joining Spotify. We really miss you at college. You&apos;re one of the few seniors at KGP from whom I got really influenced in making changes in my life. I&apos;ve been thinking of writing a letter to you since a few months as a chat/talk cannot convey the message with proper bandwidth. I wanted to talk about a lot of things. There isn&apos;t a purpose per se. If there&apos;s one thing I regret now that would be making myself away from you guys during my first year because of the intoxicated activities xD. I used to judge people blindly on the basis of their habits and think my parents are always right. As I grow up, I realise that not a single one has any idea of what they&apos;re doing in their life, how things progress and end. Everyone learns from their experiences and they think if they could change a decision that they took in the past, they could&apos;ve avoided some problems in the present but that would erase a lot of things they&apos;ve gained from their problems. This statement came from a show that I&apos;ve watched recently called Dark by Netflix. I&apos;ve been reading a lot of psychology recently and I realised that everyone who I thought was doing good has a lot of insecurities and they keep doing things having faith in their values, finding happiness in their small wins after the hardships and it&apos;s beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m getting confused a lot recently. I watched a show called Bojack Horseman and it was so depressing. Whenever I watch a single episode, I used to relate myself to the character who is a horse which always says things about life in a doomer way. I decided to read whenever I&apos;m confused and not feel bad about feeling bad about myself. Whenever I feel like reading something, I either take my kindle or read an article from the internet. I&apos;ve read your blog posts and letters multiple times and each time I read, I get a new insight. Thanks for writing those. I&apos;m always intrigued by the way you write things in your blog. I hope that&apos;s how you think. It&apos;s really minimal and the flow of thoughts is incredibly linear. I read a book called Think Straight by Darius Foroux last year and it feels simple to do that, but not easy. I was curious to know how I think and how contaminated my thoughts are. I recently did a dopamine detox. It&apos;s more than a digital detox. I stayed away from my laptop, phone, television, kindle, instant gratification activities, talking with people, tea/coffee, etc. for 24 hours. Things I did were meditating and documenting my thoughts. Documentation of thoughts to clear the mind and to learn how you think is called brain vomit. I read about this somewhere from the internet. I always used to reset myself once in a week by smoking up and it does just the opposite of dopamine detox. But this thing was hard. I ended up meditating thrice. I didn&apos;t use an app or a specific technique per se. I was just accepting my thoughts by closing my eyes. So 3x1hr sessions. From the very next day, I felt fresh and relieved. I could do anything I was struggling with before. That frustration whenever I stuck while coding up a problem, the difficulties I faced while reading research papers which made me think about my lack of understanding capacity and whatnot - every distraction was just gone. I did my workout for 1hr followed by the remote work I&apos;ve been trying to do and read my kindle in between. That day was beautiful. It went exactly as I planned but when I tried to sleep at night, I just couldn&apos;t sleep. The next day I wasn&apos;t insisting to do anything per se. Just did the things I felt like doing but I turned off the push notifications on my phone and used the internet when it was necessary only. I could sleep at that night very well. I felt interesting to experiment the things out of the books I read about habits. This doesn&apos;t seem to be the one suitable for me. I should adapt slowly by accepting my imperfections I feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m closing this letter with this last paragraph. This is about things just getting right and suddenly everything goes wrong but still managing to breathe. When I visited New York for a code sprint last year, I was mind blown by the things I saw there. I wanted to visit the US again. I&apos;d dreamed of settling there. So, I started working hard with the research and it took more than two months to get two of the FTs accepted with funding. There are long stories behind that. But that would make this letter even longer. So, I&apos;m omitting those. I&apos;d to setup my BTP also and I wanted to do that in CS dept. I sent mails to some profs, some didn&apos;t reply, some replied negatively and one replied positively asking me to meet him in the office. I&apos;d hopes on him but he humiliated me instead there. I was like I am not good enough, I should be doing most of the people are doing and couldn&apos;t aim big. On the last date of application submission, I mailed a prof who didn&apos;t even reply once before and was not found in his office whenever I tried to meet him. I mailed him just for the sake of it as my facad told me that he would extend the deadline if I forward him a mail to a prof asking for BTP. Unexpectedly, he agreed to mentor me. Suddenly everything felt like were going exactly as I planned. The very next day US declared emergency because of covid and I just can&apos;t go there for my summers. They agreed to mentor me remotely though. I reached home just before the lockdown and it&apos;s been two months now. My parents are really happy to have me around. They&apos;re afraid of me getting away from them. It&apos;s really hard to work from home. This covid made me afraid to settle abroad and still got me confused. This letter turned out to be really long and contain a lot of personal information. I didn&apos;t do that on purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regards,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi :name-retracted:,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for writing this letter. Also, thank you for opening up and sharing the thoughts from your mind. This is a rare pleasure. Let me try to reciprocate! :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first saw you on a Metakgp demo day event and I have been fascinated by you since then. Those were the early years of KOSS. I was looking for people in KGP who resonated with the idea. I would always carry a mental model of students with me who were perfect for a community like KOSS and people who would definitely enjoy being there. What you were in your first year, soon became the face of my mental model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With your experience, intellect and ability to communicate, you are easily someone I wanted to be in my first year. I am glad our efforts and the people involved in the KGP Open Source community fascinated you and now we are close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you wrote above related to intoxication made me so excited! They have been some of my favourite topics to talk about. Externally it looks like a conversation about having a drink early in college, but the bigger picture is more about waking up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe most of us in our first year are not awake in many senses. Just after the restless two years of the grand exam preparation, we are not ready to own our thoughts and actions. We eagerly seek advice, for someone to answer us -- What now?. We are sensitive and vulnerable to our surroundings. Some of us use the words of our parents and guardians as the governing principles of our life. Some of us blindly follow the first few seniors that we meet and spend our whole college life doing things which we wouldn&apos;t have done otherwise. This is harmful in many ways but not necessarily bad for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking about life in college, I am currently reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11084145-steve-jobs&quot;&gt;Steve Jobs biography by Walter Isaacson&lt;/a&gt;. The pages about his college life are inspiring to me. I would not do everything that he used to do (Extreme diets, sleeplessness, not showering, being rude to parents/people in general), but his energy and attitude towards life defined him in those moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The young students of IITs refusing to do some things which the society has asked them not to do, is a grey area to talk about. Without forcing anything on them, I would instead share one of these questions that I asked myself very early in college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Am I thinking for myself?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do I question everything?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How important is it for me to solve this assignment?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What difference will it make if I get a B instead of A or EX grade?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is this the best use of my time?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do I have the right people around me?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are my friendships healthy? Am I exploring the depths of my relationships?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do I love the work that I do or want to do in future?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good news is that a lot of us start thinking for ourselves sooner or later. But to do it as early as possible is an amazing experience and shows us the parts of life which we couldn&apos;t have seen otherwise. To sum it up, I am not directly promoting drinking and smoking up in college. Doing it mindlessly has bad consequences for most of us. They are nothing but a medium for us to start living a free life in a higher state of consciousness. What you have written above about the realisation and acceptance makes you brave, and you should see it this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your words about my blog. I am influenced by &lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/talk.html&quot;&gt;Paul Graham&apos;s Write Like You Talk essay&lt;/a&gt;. I was in the literary society back in college and I would see writers complicate their pieces by trying to write in a very different, unreal way, which they thought is aesthetic. At the same time, I was fascinated by the poems and proses which were easy to comprehend but much harder to fully understand. Talking about Paul Graham, my favourite essay from him is called &lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/vb.html&quot;&gt;Life is Short&lt;/a&gt;. I keep getting back to this essay every couple months. It is heartfelt advice for people of our age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lovely to hear about your full day dopamine detox. Damn, I could never do it now. If my mother tried calling me on Whatsapp and I wouldn&apos;t respond in an hour or two, she will start getting worried. But, I respect the idea. I am also fascinated by the 10 days Vipassana meditation course where we eat less, live in silence and do Vipassana meditation 10 hours per day, to witness thoughts and sensations come and go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember that you quit Facebook too. It is amazing how we want to spend a healthy life by being mindful about all the dopamine agents around us. I think one of the worst habits of people (including me) is that we do not respect the time between waking up in the morning and us connecting and catching up with the internet. That period of time determines how the rest of our day will go. Some people call it having a slow morning, which is doing slow, mundane things in that block of time. It includes things like making coffee, making our bed, washing dishes, showering, staring outside at the morning sun, etc. This slowness boosts our energy for the rest of the day. For me, nothing is worse than getting up from bed and scrolling Twitter for 10 minutes straight. That dials down my tempo for hours in the day. You can read more about &quot;Slow Morning&quot; on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am personally sad to see the effects of COVID-19 on the college students. I feel sad that you didn&apos;t get to experience the internship in the US. But I&apos;m happy to know that you got to work remotely!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your story with the professors back in KGP is disappointing. For me, it has been a vicious circle of me skipping classes and me not learning anything from my professors. The segregation of departments and disciplines is a legacy model and affects many students who want to study subjects outside of our assigned departments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me end by mentioning a letter from Richard Feynman called &lt;a href=&quot;https://lettersofnote.com/2015/10/23/do-not-remain-nameless-to-yourself/&quot;&gt;Do not remain nameless to yourself&lt;/a&gt;. He wrote this to one of his PhD students after winning the Nobel Prize. You might have read this already. It is inspiring for people in Science and Technology. Barriers like nasty professors or broken interview systems will not stop you and me from accomplishing what we want to do. &quot;No problem is too small or too trivial if we can really do something about it.&quot; Someone as skilful as you should grow thick skin for them and keep working on things that you love. I know you love solving problems and creating software. It should be all that is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely enjoy the time at home with family. Let&apos;s keep in touch.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Joining Spotify in Sweden]]></title><description><![CDATA[Image source Life in Japan All the things that I knew about Japan turned out to be true, as soon as I arrived here 8 months ago.

&lt;p&gt;All the things that I knew about Japan turned out to be true, as soon as I arrived here 8 months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan is a &lt;strong&gt;beautiful&lt;/strong&gt; place to live! The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry_blossom&quot;&gt;cherry blossoms&lt;/a&gt; season just started. There is a lot of nature surrounding downtown Tokyo. I haven&apos;t experienced the peak of summer here yet, but the cold climate has been cherry on top of it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent five years in my college campus where you could spot trees from anywhere (my hostel room, classrooms and the roads). Having all this nature around me once again was a relief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most &lt;strong&gt;people are mindful, quiet and private&lt;/strong&gt;. This is great for those who want to live a private life. I believe my friends and I used to be the only ones talking in the entire freaking train.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delicacies&lt;/strong&gt;! I don&apos;t remember having a bad meal ever. The proportion size and the amount of calories are thoughtfully decided. The meals are prioritized to be healthy &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; tasty. This is not true for many countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan is very &lt;strong&gt;safe&lt;/strong&gt;. I know many of my friends never locked their apartments before going out (bad idea). Walking outside late at nights does not feel threatening. I am raised to be careful about incoming traffic and being stoic about what could go wrong. Certainly, I have never had any bad experience. I didn&apos;t encounter any homeless people either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city is mostly clean. People do not enter anyone&apos;s house with their shoes on. There is almost zero vandalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;customer service&lt;/strong&gt; can not be imagined and replicated easily in other societies of the world. I know and have heard that people in India are very helpful. I felt people in Japan sometimes do &lt;em&gt;beyond normal&lt;/em&gt; things for their customers. People take their jobs very seriously. The entire bank staff greets you when you come in. You will not be left unattended even for a minute. And everyone will say Thank you and keep bowing until you get out of the door and disappear. My God, I used to feel bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The not-so-good things that I had heard are also true!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Language barrier&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get by in Tokyo if you don&apos;t know Japanese and have friends whom you can talk to. But my life was of a &lt;em&gt;tourist&lt;/em&gt; and was limited in social terms. Essential shopping (groceries, etc.) becomes limited. I have to show an image and hope that the person can recognize what I am asking for. Using a public service e.g. Hospitals, courier service is hard. I can not enquire what I want to. Google Translate is barely helpful, and is useless most of the times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people learn Japanese after coming here. They see a life here and want to settle. As of now, I know I only want to &lt;em&gt;settle&lt;/em&gt; in India and maybe in an English speaking country. My work required no Japanese, hence I did not learn. Instead I invested my time in learning new paradigms of programming in a large company. I feel I made the right decision and learnt a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rush hour traffic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need courage to commute in the morning. Even if I wanted to start my day early, it is not going to happen. Trains are packed at more than 200% of their capacity between 7-9 AM. I won&apos;t need to hold any bars in the moving trains because maybe five people would be pushing me from all directions. Lo and behold the laws of physics, I won&apos;t fall or even move when the train accelerated. xD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Things I learnt in my first job&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;living-asynchronously&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#living-asynchronously&quot; aria-label=&quot;living asynchronously permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Living asynchronously&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three years ago, I read this blog post by Quincy Larson, the founder of freecodecamp.org, titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/live-asynchronously-c8e7172fe7ea/&quot;&gt;Live asynchronously.&lt;/a&gt;. I got inspired by it. I took the concepts of Promises and callbacks in Javascript on a philosophical level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working Synchronously is the easy option. Async is hard to code and to practice in real life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living async means writing negligible number of messages/emails which require you to constantly wait until there is response. They block you from continuing to work on something else. Living async means lesser number of unimportant meetings and sync ups. In fact, when I used to be stuck in the beginning, I used to write my doubts as long expressive messages and would not expect a response immediately. I think I learnt this from the Open Source communities. ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edit: Some folks asked me on twitter to elaborate on this, so I wrote a follow up blog post about &lt;a href=&quot;https://orkohunter.net/blog/live-asynchronously/&quot;&gt;living asynchronously&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;working-concurrently&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#working-concurrently&quot; aria-label=&quot;working concurrently permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Working concurrently&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always took two or more concurrent (independent) tasks at the same time. If I get blocked or maybe bored with the first task, I would switch to the second one and would wait until I get unblocked. It is not feasible when the first task is huge. But even then, it can be broken down into chunks of concurrent pieces. And then, I would &quot;parallelly process&quot; them on my end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to take notes aggressively when I started working. I would write more than 100 words each day. I would publish them on an internal Confluence space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main reasons for doing this were -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We forget&lt;/strong&gt;. The meetings with our managers, mentors and coworkers in our first month are crucial. They convey some of the most important things about the company, team, project, etc. It was important for me to write &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of it down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self review&lt;/strong&gt;. At the end of the day, I would go through my notes and publish a summary of things I did, things I learnt, etc. It would take 10 minutes each day. My quarterly self reviews used to be very very long and exhaustive, since I had the logs of what I did. After six months, I changed the frequency of publishing the logs to weekly, but I would still take daily private notes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Being public&lt;/strong&gt;. My page was easily accessible by visiting &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;go/himanshu&lt;/code&gt; from inside the company. I loved that I was being transparent about how I am spending my time in the company. And it also helped my indirect co-workers to know what I do here.&lt;/li&gt;

Technical specs.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working on code without documentation is not fun. You are surprised each time you add a new feature. You have low confidence when making changes. For the love of humanity, document your decisions and the architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unit tests are great. But I love end to end integration tests a lot. They give me more confidence that the functionality will not break with my PRs being merged. I couldn&apos;t resist writing an integration test for the project I was working on. &lt;a href=&quot;https://natooktesting.wordpress.com/2017/08/24/x-unit-tests-0-integration-tests/&quot;&gt;You might have seen some gifs about X unit tests and 0 integration tests.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we join a new place, we notice hundreds of things that can be done better (according to us). If I go on complaining about all, and do not offer to fix any, I am being unhelpful. So, I did not offer any unnecessary feedback or criticism unless they were constructive.

&lt;p&gt;A good engineer is supposed to see the bigger picture of a project. They collaborate hand in hand with Product managers and help in writing the Spec. They break the project into smaller tasks which help them correctly estimate the timeline. They offer creative solutions which the PM might not be aware of.
This skill comes with experience and time spent in the company and is valued by everyone around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a few months, I will relocate to Stockholm, Sweden. Hopefully, the travel is permitted by then. My work will be related to Spotify&apos;s newly open sourced project called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/spotify/backstage&quot;&gt;Backstage&lt;/a&gt;. Spotify has been developing this for four years and has now decided to open source it, to simplify the infrastructure complexity in companies. Check it out, you&apos;ll find it interesting. &lt;a href=&quot;https://backstage.io/&quot;&gt;backstage.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am personally very excited that I will get to work closely with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/decause/&quot;&gt;Remy Decausemaker&lt;/a&gt; again. Remy was my direct manager at Twitter. He now leads the Open Source program at Spotify. I have learnt so much about Open Source in the time that I have worked with him and I feel blessed that there lies more. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I know from Spotify engineering blogs and the people, it has a strong engineering culture. Teams (Squads) have autonomy of the work they do. People share knowledge and support collaboration and individual growth. I intend to stay in the company for long and hopefully I come out as a much better engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, Spotify is a product that I have been using for many years. It has helped me find artists who have touched my soul. I am very excited about what lies ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PEP 8 is Python&apos;s recommended coding style convention, popular across software written in Python language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PEP8Speaks is a GitHub app which reviews the Python code style in Pull Requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My primary motivation to create this project was to reduce the workload of code maintainers and reviewers in Open Source.&lt;/strong&gt;
They spend a valuable amount of time doing code reviews. Checking and fixing code style is something that can be automated.
Hence, it must be!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made the first commit in December 2016. I was in my third year of college. In my first two summer breaks,
I had been contributing to Open Source projects in Python,
mainly because of the Google Summer of Code program. And in a few months, I was about to be a GSoC mentor,
which meant doing code reviews.
PEP8Speaks came alive out of my personal need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating and maintaining the project was not the hardest part. After the initial few months, I rant out of all my ideas.
So, the development slowed down. Hence I wanted other projects to start using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More users meant a lot of things.
I got to work on new features, optimizations, security, etc. Being very young in my career, meant
this was a wonderful way to do Software development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PEP8Speaks is useful for an open source project which has many contributors i.e. organizations&lt;/strong&gt;.
It is not very helpful if you are the only
one working on your project. Hence most of the time, if someone finds it useful, they have to convince all the maintainers
in their organization to start using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larger orgs are more hesitant in adding new things as a requirement or dependency because they are worried that it
would not work properly.
Hence, I needed to &lt;strong&gt;build trust in the project&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, organic growth requires me to do the following -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Being open for feature requests.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many cool features in PEP8Speaks are not my original ideas, but recommendations from the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers rarely want
to change the way they work. Instead, they love bending (customizing) the tools they use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If only PEP8Speaks were to support this new feature A,&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;if only PEP8Speaks supported this feature B,&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;...we would love to adopt it!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implementing feature requests.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way of gaining trust in the community is to listen to the issues and incoming Pull Requests. These users helped
a lot in spreading the word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, I need to address all the feature requests.
But it is also limited by the time I have. So, I need to pick among those requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Having a helpful README&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every knowledge required to install and customize PEP8Speaks has to be on the README. And also, in a visually discoverable way.
Having a &lt;em&gt;kickass&lt;/em&gt; README is a must.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spreading the word at the right places&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tcJi378B2M&quot;&gt;a speaker at the SciPy 2017 conference&lt;/a&gt; in Austin.
In the lightning talks session, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtgiYrf2bv8&quot;&gt;I talked about PEP8Speaks&lt;/a&gt;.
The ballroom had close to a thousand Python developers. (SciPy conference is a yearly &quot;pilgrimage&quot; in the Scientific Python world.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is the reason, a lot of PEP8Speaks users include scientific Python projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though the project is a free and open source software, it needs to be hosted on a server to work. The server receives around 3,000 API requests per minute.
I deployed it on Heroku because it was free of cost.
Heroku gave a limited number of hours per month for the servers to run. Within 1 year, the app started exhausting all the hours
very quickly. And then I had to pay for the server costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March 2019, I wrote a case to receive funding for the project. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/OrkoHunter/pep8speaks/wiki/Funding&quot;&gt;https://github.com/OrkoHunter/pep8speaks/wiki/Funding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/OrkoHunter/pep8speaks/wiki/PSF-Grant-application&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; to the PSF for the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.python.org/psf/grants/&quot;&gt;Python Software Foundation grant&lt;/a&gt;. They agreed to cover one year of server costs. üéâ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project also received funding from &lt;a href=&quot;https://weblate.org&quot;&gt;Weblate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://ccextractor.org/&quot;&gt;CCExtractor&lt;/a&gt;, which is amazing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project does not have many bugs, but I do receive one or two issues in the repository per month. I have a local setup with
few Jupyter Notebooks where I
do the debugging and I fix the problem for them. My main concern is that debugging PEP8Speaks is not straightforward.
I want to make the development process smooth. This means the project can be maintained by more people, not one person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PEP8Speaks can be installed on public repositories with a few clicks, but running on private repositories is not trivial.
I have written the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/OrkoHunter/pep8speaks/wiki/Instructions-to-deploy-a-fork&quot;&gt;instructions to do it&lt;/a&gt;.
There are currently &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/search?q=pep8speaks&amp;#x26;type=Users&quot;&gt;9 private forks&lt;/a&gt; of PEP8Speaks, that I know of.
But, I want to make it easier for private repositories to start using it. Just like
running CircleCI or Codecov on private repos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last most important thing in my mind is to improve the infrastructure. Write more developer-focused documentation, technical spec
of the project and support new contributions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Graph Theory, we perform a search by traversing the graph. We start with one node and traverse the entire graph until we find what we are looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to do that, but the two most popular ones are &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search&quot;&gt;Breadth First Search (BFS)&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search&quot;&gt;Depth First Search (DFS)&lt;/a&gt;. The name of the method is key to what do they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In BFS, we search all the neighbour nodes first. And then search the 2nd-degree neighbours, then 3rd-degree, and so on. Here is a neat animation from Wikipedia for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/Animated_BFS.gif&quot; alt=&quot;BFS GIF&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in DFS, we start with a neighbour and keep going in its branch as deep as we can, and then backtrack to a second neighbour and go deep into its branch, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read the wikipedia articles if you want to know more. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search&quot;&gt;BFS&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#x26; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search&quot;&gt;DFS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BFS and DFS can be seen among people as traits of how they make friends. Like introversion and extroversion, BFS and DFS are the characteristics of people&apos;s approach to &lt;em&gt;friendship&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You might already have some idea by now. Take few seconds and draw a picture. Imagine two people (one doing BFS and other doing DFS)
and think how they are different. It is fun to observe and ponder. :)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;College campus life is a perfect setting to spot both kinds of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A person who is on the extreme end with &lt;strong&gt;BFS&lt;/strong&gt; would generally have a larger number of friends and smaller number of acquaintances.
They constantly seek to convert their acquaintances into friends. They do not have any hard time making friends with someone.
They have a fear of missing out on creating new friendships as time slips by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A person who is on the other extreme with &lt;strong&gt;DFS&lt;/strong&gt; would have a significant number of acquaintances but a smaller number of friends.
They would always be interested in taking their friendships on to the next level. They are NOT afraid of missing out on new friendships
and want to work a lot on the existing ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BFS&lt;/strong&gt; people can generate the same intensity in new friendships, as with their existing friends. They don&apos;t need much time for this.
Yet, most of the time BFS people are afraid to go deep into conversations with one friend. They would stop at one point.
They would fall out of conversations pretty easily. They wouldn&apos;t be interested in knowing more about their friends.
They would be certain they know enough about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DFS&lt;/strong&gt; people never get bored with the friends they hangout with. They are willing to share deepest level of spiritual secrets
with each other. It takes a significant amount of time for their newer friendships to reach the intensity of their existing
friendships. They have strong perceptions, but loosely-held. They would cheer to look at things from other people&apos;s perceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Let me know if you can think of more differences.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-words&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#final-words&quot; aria-label=&quot;final words permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Final words&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone has to do BFS first. In first year of college, you don&apos;t have enough nodes to do DFS with. So, you spend the first
(and maybe second) year doing BFS. You join clubs, you hangout with your hostel-mates, and neighbours to create
&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/threads/&quot;&gt;threads&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this, if you are a DFS person, your DFS mode will trigger. And it never stops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not have a dichotomous view on which is the right way of living. I believe one has to find the right balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have developed a habbit of writing letters to friends and family for the past few years. Today, I made some of them public at &lt;a href=&quot;/letters&quot;&gt;orkohunter.net/letters&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the letters are responses, and some have responses as well. I have included the complete correspondence in each case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the people involved in my correspondances have granted me the permission to publish them. One of them strongly encouraged me to do so, when I came up with this idea four months ago. I have removed all the names of people and places which could easily reveal their identity. I want to keep writing and hearing from them. I made sure my actions do not affect it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will keep updating the space &lt;a href=&quot;/letters&quot;&gt;orkohunter.net/letters&lt;/a&gt; based on my discretion.&lt;/p&gt;

Why did you do it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Accountability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing letters is hard. It is a kind gesture from your side but it takes time to collect your thoughts and write them down in succinct words. I have spent from three hours to a few days on each letter. Hence, it is hard to keep writing even when I want to. The awareness that I have a public space on my website, will keep me accountable to update it and to write more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. It may inspire someone to write letters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish more people write letters. A letter can do wonders if you want to convey a message with impact. We choose texts to communicate daily. People forget messages sent over Facebook and Whatsapp. But people remember letters and often re-read them in future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Some of the correspondences are so good that I want to share&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some letters along with their responses are thoughtful and fantastic read for me. I thought I should share them publicly. Read them as blog posts but in the form of a dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-do-you-think-about-letters&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#what-do-you-think-about-letters&quot; aria-label=&quot;what do you think about letters permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What do you think about letters?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes when I get any thought, I kill the urge to text, tweet or speak. I pick a pen and write it down. I think more on it, and when the content and the value increases, I write it as a letter and send it to someone, sometimes to multiple people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I listen to music while writing (Pink Floyd, post-rock, epic, ambient, chill genre). It helps my thinking. I also use music to get in the mood and amplify the relevant emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three steps in which I write one letter -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think. This occupies most (~80%) of my time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write bullet points or content subjects. These are the gists of the paragraphs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write. I stick to a conversational tone. It differs when I write a blog post or any other literary article.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost all of my letters are in the form of emails. The ones written on paper with ink are either not with me or are too personal to share. And inspired by John Keats, I too believe the words of romantic partners should be &quot;written on water&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[We should write notes (for life lessons)]]></title><description><![CDATA[During my JEE preparations, I used to make a lot of notes.

Everyone did. Our Physics teacher was a storyteller. His stories used to make me wonder. I used to write them down as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I studied for two years. Thus, it was very important to write things down and keep revising. It was impossible to remember the lessons we learnt, without making good notes. My academic journey is about to end with my graduation. I realize I would not be making any notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I was listening to an amazing podcast called &lt;a href=&quot;https://secularbuddhism.com/episodes/&quot;&gt;Secular Buddhism&lt;/a&gt;. One of the episodes made my day. I need to remember the concept in the future as well. But, I am sure I will forget this in a month or earlier. This is a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We should be making non-academic notes as well&lt;/strong&gt;. The podcast episode was like a lesson, and it is a very good idea to write it down. The writing process will also add clarity to my understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have conversations daily. We experience many things. We read books. We meditate. We observe things silently. All this time, we learn something, the quality and amount of which is subjective. Sometimes, we ponder over one thought for days to understand it upto satistication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like any other lesson, we should keep re-visiting these thoughts. This is necessary to generate value for our future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is an incredible case of note taking. There is no ultimate exam. Yet, some days may create an illusion of it.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Geniune Love and Infatuation]]></title><description><![CDATA[After a long time, I read something so meaningful on reddit.

&lt;p&gt;And I want to quote what I read and later express some of my thoughts on the subject. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/aedq0v/how_do_you_distinguish_genuine_love_for_someone/&quot;&gt;Here is the original comment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a good question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... It‚Äôs really easy to confuse it with genuine love. But for me anyway, infatuation is a lot more like a drug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs a feeling that consumes you with temporary euphoric highs, and deep, dark lows. It‚Äôs almost like a panicked state of obsession. It fills your brain so all you can think about is that person. You start to care less about what really matters in your own life...your goals, your friends, your work. All that matters when you‚Äôre infatuated, is them. And you feel a strong, leeching desire to mold yourself into the person you think they‚Äôd want you to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you‚Äôre infatuated with someone, when that person gets closer to you in any way, you feel a rush. Like you‚Äôre on cloud 9. Like you just popped a bunch of really good ecstasy. And it feels amazing in the moment. But then when you sense them distancing from you in any way...an ignored text. A rescheduled date. Flirting with another person. Going out on the town without you. Whatever. It feels like the world is crumbling...like you‚Äôre going through a withdrawal. You panic and fear you‚Äôre going to lose them. There‚Äôs a constant push/pull. In those moments of panic all you care about is pulling them back to you. Those up and downs can be maddening over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At its core, I think infatuation is latching onto the idealized picture your brain paints of someone. ... You feel in love with them even though you barely know what‚Äôs it like to really be with them. ... You start thinking crazy thoughts like ‚Äúthis person is perfect‚Äù...‚Äùthis person is the solution to all of my problems, if I can just keep them I‚Äôll be fulfilled‚Äù...‚Äùif I can‚Äôt have this person I‚Äôll never be genuinely happy‚Äù. You think you‚Äôre madly in love. But it‚Äôs all shallow. Once that person actually starts getting closer to you...the infatuation can wear off pretty quickly...and you can be left feeling confused and deflated. Like a spent firework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think most ‚Äúlove at first sight‚Äù, and honeymoon periods is really just infatuation. It can turn into love, but it‚Äôs not really. And sometimes if you‚Äôre not careful, it can blind you and drag you down into some really dark places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love on the other hand, is a lot more comfortable. It‚Äôs less erratic. It grows slowly over time and stays pretty constant. Its the general feeling of caring and warmth towards someone. You can hate someone in a current moment, but still love them overall. You can find someone to be unattractive, or incompatible...and still love them deep down. You can have a fight with the person you love, and not fear you‚Äôre going to lose them...you just want to revolve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs not like a drug...it doesn‚Äôt have the highs and lows of infatuation. Its gotta be cultivated and nurtured. You don‚Äôt lose yourself in it, or have the drive to turn into the person they want you to be...love helps you find yourself, and drives you to become the person you want to be. Love for a partner isn‚Äôt too different than the love you feel for a blood relative. It can be subtle and mellow...sometimes barely recognizable...but it‚Äôs always there. You‚Äôre connected to them at a deep primal level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This left me thinking for some time. Some of my thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We have little control over our Infatuation, but Love is a practice&lt;/strong&gt;. It is comforting to know that love is not a fixed biological property which is set since birth. It is so much about our choices. We can learn to love and become one with it. We can teach people to practice love. Infact, there exists a very profoud meditation technique called &quot;Loving-Kindness&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People can sometimes fall in love with their infatuation but never the person&lt;/strong&gt;. This is so interesting to think about! This can give someone a feeling of being in love. But as the infatuation fades, the love fades as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infatuation is not bad at all&lt;/strong&gt;. It&apos;s as if, infatuation is our survival mechanism. But love goes beyond just surviving. It is spiritual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Love is not an emotion&lt;/strong&gt;. Happiness and Sadness come in phases. They are emotions. But love is always present, in us. Our mind may get distracted sometimes. (This is whole another perception, which I felt in one experience.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Love is very fundamental and not complicated&lt;/strong&gt;. Day passes by and my definition of love keeps getting shorter. Something so easy to experience, so difficult to express.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[‡§î‡§∞ ‡§§‡§∏‡§µ‡•Ä‡§∞‡•á‡§Ç ‡§Ü‡§®‡•á ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§π‡•à‡§Ç ‡§®¬†!]]></title><description><![CDATA[You can listen to my naratted version on Youtube‚Ä¶]]></description><link>https://orkohunter.net/blog/aur-tasveerein</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://orkohunter.net/blog/aur-tasveerein</guid><pubDate>Fri, 16 Nov 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrlWoA4D5XQ&quot;&gt;You can listen to my naratted version on Youtube.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finished reading a book today. It‚Äôs called &lt;em&gt;Man‚Äôs Search for Meaning&lt;/em&gt;, written by &lt;em&gt;Viktor Frankl&lt;/em&gt;. He was a German psychiatrist captured by Hitler‚Äôs army in one of the most horrific concentration camps. If you are not aware of ‚ÄúThe Holocaust,‚Äù more than a million people were killed in those concentration camps and more than ten million Jews during World War II. In the Auschwitz concentration camp, he (the author) witnessed so many deaths and brutality during the time he was captured in prison. People were separated from their families and children. They were gassed up and killed if they were unfit for work. Surviving on very little food and medicines, all their lives were a misery. The author saw his companions losing hope for survival. Based on his own experience and the stories of his patients, Frankl argues that we cannot avoid suffering, but we can choose how to cope with it, find meaning in it, and move forward with renewed purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To save you time from reading it, I will share the things I learned from this book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see this book as an answer to ‚ÄúWhy should we not be depressed?‚Äù and a guide to handling other existential questions. One of the most asked questions by the entire humanity is ‚ÄúWhat is the meaning of my life? What is the purpose of my existence?‚Äù. These questions have been here since tens of thousand years. People have created religions to answer these questions. Righteousness (Dharma) and other ethics come out of these religions. Here is what the author says -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no abstract universal meaning to life. We should stop finding it. We do not need to ask this question. But life itself is asking this question from us. We have to answer it ourselves. This question is not ours to ask, but for us to answer. We create our meaning. Whether it is work, love, or courage. We create our ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù individually. And this ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù guides us to survive any ‚ÄúHow‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He adds that‚Ää‚Äî&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is not primarily a quest for pleasure or a quest for power, but a quest for meaning. The greatest task for any person is to find meaning in his or her life. It can be anything or anyone. Suffering in and of itself is meaningless; we give our suffering meaning by the way in which we respond to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, something which I‚Äôll always try to remember is‚Ää‚Äî&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forces beyond your control can take away everything you possess except one thing, your freedom to choose how you will respond to the situation. You cannot control what happens to you in life, but you can always control what you will feel and do about what happens to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is nothing but a relief, a motivation to lead a peaceful and meaningful life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I thought upon how we are raised, I noticed that our parents, teachers, and well-wishers try to inflict us with what gave meaning to their lives. My grandfather found purpose in a well-paid job because he had a sizeable low-income family to feed. That was it. He is 88 years old now, and the meaning of life still hasn‚Äôt changed for him. My father finds the purpose of life in a loving family. Everyone should talk to each other and support each other in their difficult times. I don‚Äôt know why he does that, but that is what I am aware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither of those two are correct nor incorrect. As an individual, I respect what drives them. But every time my grandfather says ‚ÄúI wish you get crores rupees of salary and stand 1st in your college‚Äù, I smile and silently disagree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So :name-retracted:, the next time you think of something which you have not achieved, which makes you feel you have not been successful, which threatens your self-esteem, take a minute and ask yourself ‚ÄúIs this or will this be meaningful to me?‚Äù. Meaningful doesn‚Äôt mean enjoyable but fulfilling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take care,

&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúYou‚Äôre an interesting species. An interesting mix. You‚Äôre capable of such beautiful dreams, and such horrible nightmares. You feel so lost, so cut off, so alone, only you‚Äôre not. See, in all our searching, the only thing we‚Äôve found that makes the emptiness bearable, is each other.‚Äù‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäCarl Sagan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always wonder when I listen to this quote in the song &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AoJwMImQZE&quot;&gt;Doves by We Are All Astronauts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my college, I have never walked up to a complete stranger and ended up being friends. It is hard for most people to do so. No matter how much we understand the importance of interacting with new people, mostly in the early years of our lives, it is not an easy thing to do. In my freshmen year, I never knocked the doors of my neighbors or any of my wingmates to learn about them. It was a conscious decision. But I now realize, there wasn‚Äôt a random to-be-friend knock on my door either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So many years and friendships later, I can now understand that between me and any of my friends, there is always one common ‚Äúthread.‚Äù It can be the Literary Society (TLS), or the Open Source folks, or the ones from KOTA, or my wing-mates, post-rock music, department, being intoxicated together, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For two unacquainted people to start a conversation, it is a bit difficult to talk directly about each other. It won‚Äôt even go well. But it becomes relatively simple if they talk about anything that they have in common. And then they always remember that thread connecting them for the next few meetups until they don‚Äôt need the reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs amazing how many threads KGP creates in our lives, to give us friendships for lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[On Psychedelics]]></title><description><![CDATA[I wrote - Hello :name-retracted:!

&lt;p&gt;Hello :name-retracted:!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night, I watched the movie Her. It was a fascinating movie on emotions and AI. It was one of its kind and made me think a bit. Humans created a consciousness in the movie, and at one point it started wondering about itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe a lot of humans, at some point in their lives, think about the purpose of their lives (Hilariously reminds me of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7HmltUWXgs&quot;&gt;&quot;You pass butter&quot;&lt;/a&gt;). I found myself in the situation for the first time right after JEE, but later I forgot as programming happened to me. And then, again after reading Sapiens this December. And now, it&apos;s stuck in my head. It&apos;s not always a negative thought, a lot of times I happen to be smiling and puzzled as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m glad psychedelics exist in the world. It made me constantly aware of the mysterious and unknown, made me witness colors never seen before, geometries beyond apprehension, and gifted a broad palette of emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often at times, I self-construct arguments against psychedelics being good and then later work on the counter-arguments. I have an interesting thought to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of our ancient tradition. Children during their brahmacharya were recommended to have a Guru. It was a norm to grow up having a guru. In the case of Eklayva, his teacher was a statue, not a living person. So, Guru was a concept but mostly found in the form of life. I highly recommend a thoughtful psychedelic experience to my friends once in life. I ask them to respect what they think of intaking. I believe these chemicals and plants have the potential to be the guru in this modern age. That is the thought. Also, not all teachers and teachings are good (thus, Bad Trips), but there is always a lesson to learn, always a lesson to think about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;name-retracted-responded&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#name-retracted-responded&quot; aria-label=&quot;name retracted responded permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:name-retracted: responded&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and gifted a broad palette of emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe the emotions I have collected from the small out-of-world experience I had is the best thing I kept with myself after the trip. Now I listen to the same music with more intense emotions. Now I live the same life with more vividness. (And the most wonderful thing about reading your mail is: I hadn&apos;t given many thoughts how these emotions emerged, I will now. Surely, these trips have changed my composition as human. (Romantic ahaa!))&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all have our unique mental models about the world and there are a lot of mental models trying to dictate our ways through life. (Most people aren&apos;t even aware of them. - I wasn&apos;t aware until I went for that Himachal trip).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example: the usage of &apos;we&apos; everywhere is a small mental model about the world, watching a series of actions like a sequential programmer is another mental model, trying to optimize petty things, and watching people as a neural network model is another. We had these experiences and we have these models in our mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the consequences of being from :state-name-retracted:, being a c++/python programmer, competitive programmers, deep learning engineer in the order the examples are given.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when I took pyshedelics, I created another mental model. It is about open-mindedness. It is compassionate and weak as a twig, at the same time it is strong as the storms. It embraces other mental models and tries to break them from bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe if I hadn&apos;t taken it, I wouldn&apos;t have come out from the clutches of commitment. Staying in commitment for the sake of it is biased. (Commitment in itself is not).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are about to break a commitment, there is a lot of &apos;socio-cultural&apos; norms to stop you. More than anything, it is your mind asking you not to do it for the sake of &apos;moral&apos; compass you have set. Then you realize &apos;love&apos; is greater than any norms/compass and that love shouldn&apos;t make you feel mediocre. I realized I feel more loved(more dopamine) when I see the white moon by the trees than her (This was the snap moment, our last LSD trip). I had written a small sentence during those time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Kahu kaise tujhe ki ek samandar se sukoon mila par dhoop nikalne pe wapas jana hai&quot; (Hindi)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it doesn&apos;t mean that you hate the ocean, that you have suddenly started hating it. It&apos;s just that if &apos;love&apos; is there, you&apos;ll carry the essence of the oceans within you, wherever you go.
Everyone carries something, and you shouldn&apos;t carry the things just for the sake of carrying(commitment just for the sake of commitment) but only if you want to (love).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am always a tiny bit confused in this matter. There is yet some fingerprints on the glass, next psychedelic would help me get it cleaner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here is how I used some open-mindedness I gathered from my trips. It shackled some norms set in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend a thoughtful psychedelic experience to my friends once in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just to clarify, I would like to add a single point. It&apos;s for everyone but not &apos;every&apos;time. I can provide almost anyone with an LSD but not DMT. Even :name-retracted:, I have never given him DMT. It&apos;s just that you have to feel (judge) whether they would embrace what they see. These are tough things we are looking at, it can make people but break them too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really believe you already know this but added for the sake of availability bias.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope I don‚Äôt bore you with this letter. I feel like talking to you about life. (Which I always want to do. All the time. It‚Äôs almost like I met you yesterday and quickly got comfortable in saying things.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So. There we go. There is a married couple somewhere on the outskirts of a town, renting a one bedroom apartment in a 10-story dull looking building. They have a median family income. (Imagine the couple in movie The Lunchbox). The family wakes up and goes to work. The wife prepares and sends him the lunchbox. And she always does thousands of other household chores, which look trivial but are as difficult as any job. The days are tiring. The couple gets together for dinner later in the evening. Let‚Äôs say they watch a movie, or a reality dance show with a celebrity guest, or maybe a scheduled TV serial, as usual. And this goes on for a long time. Like, really long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They constantly feel that something is missing. Suddenly, their lives look like an incomplete picture in front of them. They realize maybe they don‚Äôt have it all. So they decide to do what billions of us have decided in the past, i.e. to raise a kid. The kid gives them love to share in exchange for some financial load and a whole lot of time from both their lives. But they get happier, or maybe. Their lives go on, a bit busier than before. They are 3 people now. Everything is new to the child, so he/she is excited as hell. But the mundane stuff starts happening again. The dinner, the TV, the feeling of ‚Äúsomething missing‚Äù from their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So many of these families never figure out what was missing. I have seen a few. There are millions of them in our country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this time, these people look at something only to realize, they don‚Äôt have it. They look at people in the movies/serials wearing clothes which they don‚Äôt have. The house, they don‚Äôt have. The parties they don‚Äôt go to. Or the romance, as shown in the movies. All of the mainstream media shows them things that they want, but do not have. But the worst part is, that the media tells them that those things exist and there is still hope, most of which is imaginary. So, they live in the expectation of achieving something which does not exist in reality or is too tedious to get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have known this for a long time. But only now I realize, it‚Äôs very natural for us to do that. This has been going on for thousands of years. It‚Äôs called the human‚Äôs struggle for finding the meaning of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We think we live with a purpose. And that we were sent with a purpose. We invented religion to make us believe that there is a white-bearded man above the clouds, always looking at us and that he loves all of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, when a self-awakened man comes and says, ‚ÄúYou know what, we don‚Äôt exist with any purpose at all‚Äù. Or when Carl Sagan tells us about how vast our entire universe is and that we are nothing but pale blue dots in the whole picture; we feel so small. And that‚Äôs it. At this point, the one who realizes and accepts that we are not special, is known as a Buddha, and rest of us constantly miss out on life desiring to be special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is wrong with not being special?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not a thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason why I am saying all this to you is that I don‚Äôt worry about our love not being what it isn‚Äôt. I am a simple guy, who thinks about the girl he loves when he wakes up and looks at her picture before going to bed in the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I think as much as I accept this love as it is, the more joyful I can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bas itna hi kehna tha, kuch jyada shabdon mein :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IS THIS EVEN POSSIBLE?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BUT YOU PROBABLY NEED TO BE A DC ADMIN TO GET THIS, NO?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nope. Anyone can do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holy Schnikes!!!! TELL ME HOW TO DO IT ON DC++!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: I shall not be giving out a one-click solution to monitor DC searches intentionally even if it were possible. But if you are dedicated enough, you can figure things out by reading it. Also, I‚Äôm not the first person to know about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_Connect_%28protocol%29&quot;&gt;What is DC?&lt;/a&gt; It‚Äôs a peer-to-peer file sharing protocol. Computers connected with each other can share files among them, and if you are on LAN, you get them on a terrific speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GET TO THE POINT!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright, alright.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs say Mr X and I are connected to a DC hub. Let‚Äôs say it happens that both of us are online at the same time. Mr X searched for &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;New movies&lt;/code&gt; in their favorite DC client e.g. DC++, LinuxDC++, etc. Their client sends this request to the hub we both are connected, to fetch a search result. The hub then forwards the request to &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; who is connected to it and returns the index for Mr X to click and download any file from anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SO GIVE ME THE SCRIPT. OR DO YOU HAVE THE CODE OR A REPOSITORY?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There isn‚Äôt really a script or any code. :/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the theory, we can sit back, stay connected to the hub and receive a holy large amount of data like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who joined/left the hub when, their nick and their IP address&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are people searching for and IP address associated with each query&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normal DC clients won‚Äôt allow us to see these requests. There is a client known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.yorhel.nl/ncdc&quot;&gt;ncdc&lt;/a&gt; (distributed as a binary) which doesn‚Äôt really have a GUI, so you can run it on a terminal (Aah, the feels it gives!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use ncdc to connect to the hub&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable logging to a file and set &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;log_debug&lt;/code&gt; to True&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: This will generate a lot of data if you‚Äôre connected to a large hub and thus make sure you keep clearing the log file&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;tail -f /path/to/logfile&lt;/code&gt; to see the queries sent by DC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parse the queries and tada!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protip: You can feed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana&quot;&gt;Kibana&lt;/a&gt; the data and visualize them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You probably will have to set some config in ncdc to change from Passive mode to Active mode or else, some hubs mights ban you. Google properly, read the ncdc documentation and you‚Äôll be fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EDIT: &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@icyflame&quot;&gt;Siddharth Kannan&lt;/a&gt; used tcpdump to capture the TCP/IP packets which contains the DC query strings as well. Check out the 107,000 search results he accumulated in a week over here stored as &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;all_packet_info.json&lt;/code&gt;. This is the code he used&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;sudo tcpdump -b -t src 10.109.xx.xx -w incoming-search-`date +%s`.pcap -c 1000;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs hard. But if you really want to live stream the searches and that to be accessible outside of the campus network, there is a hack. You can have a server hosted somewhere outside the network which is going to stream data to the public. Share the URL of this server to people you want to. Create an endpoint over here which can receive data through POST request. Now, use your laptop from inside the network to constantly send requests on to the server. Make sure to use authentication by headers to avoid exploitation!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/OrkoHunter/dc-audio/&quot;&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; leftover &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/OrkoHunter/dctrends&quot;&gt;code&lt;/a&gt; if you can find use of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you have this, here‚Äôs something you need to remember: Don‚Äôt be dick. That‚Äôs all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Layers of ‚ÄòI‚Äô when perceiving anything which is external to it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Montaigne, one of the first essay writers, for popularizing this literary genre. As the title suggests, I have had many musings upon the similarity and the differences of these three entities which can be thought as a subset of ‚Äò&lt;em&gt;I‚Äô&lt;/em&gt; and which have very diffused boundaries among their definitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/strong&gt;: The following ideas are highly subjective. I would not advise the reader to consider them factual. Also, instead of focusing too much on the scientific details, the reader should try to read the hints to what I‚Äôm trying to communicate by using language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;lets-define&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#lets-define&quot; aria-label=&quot;lets define permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Let‚Äôs Define&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cogito ergo sum (I think therefore I am) ‚Äî Ren√© Descartes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entity ‚ÄòI‚Äô or ‚ÄòMe‚Äô is a strange topic of discussion. While some people would oversimplify this to the human body, others might overcomplicate and make this is a subject of spiritual mysticism. I want to remain sane on this topic and probably write the words which can make sense in daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, the majority of ‚ÄòI‚Äô is divided into three parts or layers, namely the Brain, the Mind and the Consciousness. The Brain is the outermost layer, the frontier of the Self. Take a scenario for example. You are reading this text. The first ‚ÄòYou‚Äô is your eyes, receiving colorful light rays from the screen. The ‚ÄòYou‚Äô then converts this information into electrical signals for further processing. This part is called Brain. It is an entirely physical entity, made of matter which interacts with the outer world through our senses, i.e., sight, touch, smell, taste, and sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Brain is very close to a computer program, and vice versa. It is programmed to execute in a definite manner. When given a set of inputs, it runs the required number and type of processes and is done with it. It encounters bugs in its lifetime which causes the dysfunctioning of some module. It also has a computing power and needs resources such as oxygen and food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Brain then tries to pass this information to our Consciousness but in comes the Mind. The Mind is that child of ours, whom we love so much that we probably can never stop listening to. The Mind constitutes of our thoughts, our emotions associated with those thoughts, reactions and Ego. If you have disliked this essay so far, your brain has nothing to do with it; it just is feeding the information to your Mind, which is sitting only to judge the content. The Mind will then react and ask your Brain (followed by the senses) to either continue or stop reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can look at the Mind as a semi-physical entity. On one side it shares boundaries with the physical bodies like sensations and hormones, while on the other hand, it has slight access to the metaphysical entities inside us which are hard to define as matter, i.e., Consciousness and Ego.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Consciousness is the purest form of ‚ÄòI,‚Äô which does not think, which does not react, which does not speak with our mouth, which does not listen with our ears, which does not recognize anything as good or bad, pleasant or unpleasant. It is a thoughtless entity. It can interchangeably be understood as ‚Äòthe energy of life‚Äô. If you have ever been a psychonaut, this is the ‚Äòvibration‚Äô part of self, and it does communicate to other consciousness. If your consciousness is unaware of something which only your brain and mind knows (Take the statement ‚Äò&lt;em&gt;We should love everyone&lt;/em&gt;‚Äô for example), it is entirely possible that you might react unexpectedly in extreme situations, contradictory to what you think you should never have done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you remember the scene from the epic Mahabharat? During the battle scene, the chariot with the most attention was of Arjun. Now there‚Äôs a great symbolism to be drawn from the setting. There is Arjun with all the weapons, perplexed with the myriad of thoughts about the battle, sitting on a chariot with Krishna, who is calm and patiently replying to all of the questions thrown by Arjun. Krishna is also the charioteer, holding the reins. There are horses driving the chariot, and finally, there‚Äôs the battleground, the vast ground where the chariot can roam around and interact with other chariots and other entities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collectively if we are to compare this one picture with ‚ÄòI,‚Äô the chariot is similar to a Body. Arjun is like the Mind having all of its thoughts, ego, and confusions. Krishna is the inner Consciousness. The reins connect the Mind with the horses, which are to be interpreted as the senses we use to interact with the external world, which here is the entire battleground of Kurukshetra. The ‚ÄòI‚Äô functions when everything is at their place, resonating in perfect coordination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all the questionnaire (popularly known as Bhagavad Gita), Krishna drives the chariot and is only capable of waking Arjun up and channeling all of his powers. I don‚Äôt know how reliable this symbolism should be held but loosely it‚Äôs very similar to the game of Mind and Consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How are these entities altered?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changing the Brain is straightforward. One can close their eyes, put on earphones with music and there, the state of their Brain is now different. But closing the eyes does not mean the person shall stop thinking about it. The change in Brain has little to no effects on the Mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changing the Mind is a tedious process. It requires expertise to govern thoughts from coming in and going out. It is a long process to gain control over one‚Äôs Ego. These methods can be classified under various Meditative techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changing the Consciousness makes you a Psychonaut. A Psychonaut is a person who experiences intentionally induced altered states of consciousness and claims to use the experience to investigate his or her Mind, and possibly address spiritual questions, through direct experience. A change in Consciousness will, by default, reflect on the Mind and the Brain as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people talk about Enlightenment, they mean altered Consciousness and not a new Mind. All the humans feel love, sadness, hate, anger, etc., every single one of us and is, in fact, one of the traits which define us. A monk in the Himalayas is undoubtedly not deprived of Mind, but they probably know how to open up with the Consciousness directly and not let Mind be a middle-man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enlightenment doesn‚Äôt care how we reach there.‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäThaddeus Golas&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consciousness can be altered with prolonged meditation (very subjective to the technique and the person). The use of naturally occurring mushrooms containing psilocybin, DMT, LSD and many other psychedelic and psychoactive substances can also challenge Consciousness to its very core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;communication&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#communication&quot; aria-label=&quot;communication permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Communication&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm not sure if there is any test to know whether some information which was thrown at us, has reached our consciousness or not. Merely hearing it ensures Brain level perception. Pondering over it as a thought provides that it is floating in our Mind. But how can we know if our Consciousness is aware of it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one practice which can make sure the thought isn‚Äôt stuck in the Mind. The method is to ‚ÄúAvoid Overthinking.‚Äù Overthinking is terrible. It is a risky business. On the one hand, it opens up new insights to a thought, on the other side it leads to the loss of reality and makes it very hard for any information to escape from our Minds. Another good practice is to not letting our Ego come into the picture. We can do it by not allowing our subjective feelings and judgment interfere while we catch a piece of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing that ‚ÄòI‚Äô can be dissolved into these three entities can have very positive effects while communicating with others. If we can see that our words will be reflected by their layer of Ego, there is no way we can deliver our message to them despite speaking for any length of time, since it will never reach their Consciousness. We can then find out the correct choice of words to avoid their shiny surface of Mind which is eager to reflect anything that is thrown towards it such that it pierces through and reaches their Consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many times, we have the tendency to solve a problem with another person, just by speaking to them. Example can be a conflict of interest with our parents, friends or a significant other. But it‚Äôs wise to understand that the situation might have left the Mind of the other person very confused, and it‚Äôs best not to talk since our words will quickly bounce off them. It‚Äôs better to sit back, wait, till they work out with their Mind and are ready to communicate. Interesting to note that this is counter-intuitive to our Minds which quickly reacts by blabbering out whatever we can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is ‚Äúwatching the breath‚Äù one of the first and simplest meditation techniques? During Vipassana, it is suggested to start first by the practice of watching the whole breathing cycle and rather focus on the nostrils. This is not Vipassana, but it acts as an anchor to calm the Mind so that we would be able to do the actual practice. We can give an analogy of the mind to that of a chattering monkey. The Mind usually does not shut up and keeps feeding us with thoughts, ego, and their effects. We then tell the Mind, ‚ÄúO hey! Do you see this? Do you see me inhaling and exhaling? It‚Äôs beautiful, isn‚Äôt it? Watch!‚Äù. It‚Äôs like giving a crying baby, a toy to play with and making her come at ease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we start watching our thoughts, we begin to accept, and later appreciate the meaninglessness of them. Merely by watching them come and go, we build up a tolerance for a reaction, and it stops us from engaging from them in the future. We learn how futile are our thoughts, opinions, and judgments. Often at times, people are afraid of meaninglessness, which makes them value their thoughts very much. This makes them misinterpret that they are their thoughts, and thus, they build up a thick layer over their Consciousness, which is another meaningless and thoughtless entity. There is a possibility that life gets more beautiful if we stop yearning for everything to be meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;ego&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#ego&quot; aria-label=&quot;ego permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Ego&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ego is a word which has been overstated and misunderstood a lot of times. Never is one‚Äôs true ego positive or negative, it‚Äôs the thoughts associated with it. A negative thought pattern can be removed while keeping the Ego intact. We just can‚Äôt let it happen very easily, since it‚Äôs so powerful. Ego is the ID of the Mind; it‚Äôs what makes us respond to someone calling our name. It might sound blissful to live after ‚ÄòEgo Death‚Äô, but that‚Äôs not how anyone can survive. Killing one‚Äôs ego is killing Self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If ego death isn‚Äôt desirable, then what is? Here is a comment from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/43oysz/how_is_ego_death_beneficial/czjv2nn/&quot;&gt;/r/Psychonaut&lt;/a&gt; which I find very relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I don‚Äôt believe complete Ego death is possible, or even desirable. What I suggest is mastery of the Ego. Think of it like a wild animal to be tamed instead of destroyed. It is a part of you, an integral and important one, in fact, but for most people, it‚Äôs grown monstrous and completely out of control. Or put differently, it is in full control. And so we become passengers in these meat machines, with the Ego at the wheel. Dangerous stuff!
The Ego is only the Ego so long as it remains distinct and separate from the rest of you. The process we should undergo is what Carl Jung called individuation: the uniting of a fractured mind, of a psyche, compartmentalized and segregated into individual parts; the merging of conscious and unconscious, Self and Ego, reasoning mind and intuitive mind. The result is that we become indivisible, whole, balanced, and more importantly, in control.
How does this benefit you? Well, imagine two pilots wrestling for control of the ship. Good luck getting to your destination! Or better yet, good luck agreeing on a target. Before individuation, we‚Äôre torn and divided, conflicted and confused. We‚Äôre being driven, not doing the driving, you see? The Ego wants one thing, the Self another, and then it‚Äôs a battle for control. Or else the Ego is whispering sweet lies, and the Self is buying them wholesale so that the Self comes to believe that it and the Ego are one. This is a nice little tactic by the Ego, and one that can be observed in people on a daily basis. Defensiveness is an obvious indication of Ego identification. What are you defending? An opinion? A belief? A role? These things are not you, only things you do or things you cling to, but the Ego grows strong from false identification and so pokes and prods you into getting your back up whenever these are called into question.
How do you merge with the shadow? The first step is identifying it in yourself by distinguishing between the essential you‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe Self, or pure consciousness‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand the stuff that isn‚Äôt you. By watching your thoughts, words, and actions, seeking out incoherence and contradictions, defensiveness and sore spots, and then calling these into question. Be harsh with yourself. And whatever you do, don‚Äôt shy away from the ugly bits: that‚Äôs where the Ego likes to hide out.### Ignorance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don‚Äôt we hate it when we write or speak all the facts and support our argument while the person on the other side just &lt;em&gt;chooses&lt;/em&gt; to ignore those and raises some of their own? It is happening every second on Facebook and Twitter comments section, and it‚Äôs eating out a lot of Brains. But why do people choose to be ignorant?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moment we add our entire Mind in the equation of &lt;em&gt;thought process&lt;/em&gt;, it by default, includes the sensations in our body, emotional reactions, opinions, and separately, the Brainly activities, i.e., Reading/Listening and Writing/Speaking. Now, the Brain has no trouble in receiving any argument, neither the Consciousness has; but it‚Äôs the Mind, and if the words are causing any unpleasant sensations, we tend to reject it. And that‚Äôs where we lose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No sensation is either good or bad. However, it &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; arise. It‚Äôs natural for all of us. The key is not in ceasing it, but accepting it, accepting that impermanence is a real thing. The sensations have come, only to pass away. It has no real meaning, and we should not be trying to give it any value. We indulge in reactions too often and thus end up losing the direct communication with our Consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;consciousness&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#consciousness&quot; aria-label=&quot;consciousness permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Consciousness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, we only know the tip of the iceberg known as Consciousness. I am very impressed by Yuval Noah Harari‚Äôs understanding of the consciousness and the scientific aspects of it, written in his book &lt;em&gt;Homo Deus&lt;/em&gt;. To me, understanding one‚Äôs consciousness is a very complicated subject since it‚Äôs very easy to overthink it. It is the subjective ability to experience. Anything can be an experience, merely sitting somewhere alone in lush green, or talking to a person, or watching the leaves fall from a tree, anything and everything can become an experience and our consciousness is responsible for the subjective aspects of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm not capable of writing about it. I‚Äôm not capable of using terms like ‚ÄòVibration‚Äô and ‚ÄòEnergy‚Äô to describe it. But I secretly wish, for a scientific explanation in centuries when we‚Äôd be pondering over the consciousness of Artificial Intelligence. Even if I can see things as it is (it‚Äôs the literal meaning of &lt;em&gt;Vipassana&lt;/em&gt;), I wish things to be proven for a systematic understanding by the humanity. Wait, what is String Theory &lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[#DeleteFacebook]]></title><description><![CDATA[After letting Facebook Inc. build a vast profile of me for 9 years, I deleted my facebook account.

If we pick two homo sapiens on earth, we can classify their relationship as one of these three types:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An Acquaintance (Both of them are acquainted with each other)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unfamiliarity (No one knows about the existence of other)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Celebrity status (One of the two is famous)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today is the dawn of the 21st century. And every day in my college I meet few people who fall in none of the three types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every day I see people on 2.2, whom I know by face and name, as well as they know me and my name. But we don‚Äôt stop to say, ‚ÄòHi‚Äô&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;These are my &lt;em&gt;pseudo-acquaintances&lt;/em&gt; whom I got to know from Facebook.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the deal. Somewhere in the data centers of Facebook Inc, there is a matrix which stores the connection between two nodes, and the edge value of those people and me is True. There have been numerous CSS divs containing strings which either they or I have written, which got a click from the other, sometimes a further div of ‚Äúcomment‚Äù as well. Somehow, subconsciously my brain understood that a person and I had interacted a whole bunch and thus we are friends. But when the same mind physically spots them in public, that same person for the first time in months, there is no surge of emotions to go and talk to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know someone on Facebook, I ‚Äúinteract‚Äù with them, but I don‚Äôt speak with the same passion or eagerness to them in real life, using flesh and bones. For me, it is terrifying. What if people eventually stop using their mouth for conversations because Whatsapp and Messenger let them use that gif meme to convey more efficiently. What if we discover some other app or platform to express ourselves in the best way which is different than meeting the person and using our mouth, eyes, face, hands or smile to express?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the fact that the first world countries already have incorporated a bit of this culture, raises merely questions about parenting. What if we are not concerned about our children, and the first friend they make, do not physically exist around them. I am surely, not saying one is better than others; there are so many pros of the Scientific Revolution, Internet being a tiny monster of it. I am just saying that, are people responsible? Is Facebook responsible enough to know that it has created an illusion of friendships and relationship and does it care about it? From the weekly product and feature launches, for the sole purpose of us interacting more on their platform, and increasing their value as advertisers and not looking up from our phones, I think it does not care at all. Or is it in control of anyone to care about it? Something like a trained Deep Learning model, over which we only have very few control after some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&gt; This article above was an email to a few close friends, right after I realized my first pseudo-acquaintance. I am thankful to their responses, they made me rethink every bit.
&lt;p&gt;It has been quite long since I joined Facebook.com and I have spent a lot of time with the product. I have met and stayed connected with a lot of people using this platform, and therefore, I am probably thankful for it. However, here is my current setup, as of now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don‚Äôt use the product ‚Äònews feed‚Äô. I use a version of News Feed Eradicator.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I ran a custom Javascript script to unfollow all of my Facebook friends and then turned on the notifications for few, as I deemed necessary in my real life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the phone, I do not have the Facebook app and I use messenger with the setting where I do not receive any notification (interrupts) but I would instead open the app to see if there any new messages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last thing that I want to say is that there are mostly no good and no wrong sides. As a human, we always have to use our discretion and find something in between. Hence I can not blindly delete Facebook to solve this problem, I‚Äôll have to see the way to use it for my productivity, as long as it doesn‚Äôt consume a lot of my time to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something provocative happened with me yesterday. I was with :name-retracted: in CCD after you left. We were there for quite some time. Meanwhile, a group of people came in, including a friend from TLS. I went ahead and had a brief conversation with him. But when I noticed, there was one girl in the group whom I also knew! You know her; she is the one from the early times of :group-name-retracted: (I think you met her on :place-name-retracted:). There was a brief moment of eye contact, but it instigated no emotion. I could not even say &quot;Hi&quot; because of the bland reaction on our faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we were leaving, we noticed that she was coming out of CCD too. From there to Veggies, :name-retracted: and I walked alongside her. I am not able to forget those 40 seconds; there was too much silence to remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now here is the deal. Somewhere in the datacenters of Facebook Inc, there is a matrix which stores the connection between two nodes, and the edge value of her and me is True. There have been numerous CSS divs containing strings or bytecodes which either she or I have written, which got a click from the other, sometimes a further div of &quot;comment&quot; as well. Somehow, subconsciously my brain understood that this person and I had interacted a whole bunch and thus we are friends. But when the same mind physically spotted that same person for the first time in months, it was speechless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For centuries, there have roughly and popularly been two types of edges between homo sapiens, either they are acquainted with each other, or they are not. For the past decade, a third type has emerged. You know someone on Facebook, you &quot;talk&quot; to them, but you don&apos;t talk with that passion or eagerness to them in real life with using flesh and bones (Remember :name-retracted:?). For me, it is terrifying. What if people eventually stop using their mouth for conversations because Whatsapp and Messenger lets them use that gif meme to convey. What if we discover some other app or platform to express ourselves in the best way which is different than meeting the person and using our mouth, eyes, face, hands or smile to express?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the fact that the first world countries already have incorporated a bit of this culture, simply raises questions on parenting. What if we are not concerned about our children, and the first friend they make do not physically exist around them. I am definitely not saying one is better than others, there are so many pros of the Scientific Revolution, Internet being a tiny monster of it. I am just saying that, are people responsible? Is Facebook responsible enough to know that it has created an illusion over friendships and relationship and does it care about it? From the weekly product and feature launches, for the sole purpose of us interacting more on their platform, and increasing their value as advertisers and not looking up from our phones, I think it does not care at all. Or is it in control of anyone to care about it? Something like a trained Deep Learning model, over which we only have very few control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a curious homosapien, who used the internet to blab to you about internet. But yes, I know we have to have this conversation when we meet and this exchange of email shouldn&apos;t be the end, and that makes me feel better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi!
This predicament, as you are feeling, is understandable. The oddity of changing societal rules and relationships, brought about by social-media corporations, is at times overwhelming. But if you try to understand this phenomenon at an abstract level, then perhaps we can get a bigger picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you have thought to be a &quot;fake&quot; acquaintance is not fake per se, but just another expression of the changes that are taking place in our society due to social media. It is at best, friendship in the normal sense of the word or at worst, a &quot;virtual&quot; acquaintance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humanity has come so far only because of the large-scale cooperations between diverse groups of people.This cooperation could be achieved, thanks to fictional stories like religions, society, and other collectivities which made it easier for people to trust each other. But as we all know, socio-political evolutions necessitated new stories to bind people together, and in the process, we developed theories like democracy, communism, nation-states to fit the narrative of the time better. So the critical thing to note here is that as the narrative has changed so have the rules governing the society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is in this context that I want to place your qualms about the internet. The internet is undoubtedly forcing us to adopt a new narrative of our time and respecting the course of history over several millennia; we must be ready to accept this reality and better adapt to the changing times by altering the &quot;rules&quot; of the society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming to the specific case of &quot;acquaintance on the facebook but not in real life,&quot; I do not find anything odd here. In fact, I find it empowering that acquaintances could be made even without knowing each other in real life. It is for the first time human-history that you can cooperate and collaborate with others, on a large and expansive scale, even without knowing them in real life. You don&apos;t need to have commonalities like religion, nationalities, ideologies and any other collectivities to come together and cooperate with each other. Cooperation is not predicated on external factors which are not in your control but internal factors that you can control. A person from Pakistan can send me a friend request on facebook, and if I want, I can become his friend and vice-versa. The acquaintance or the friendship, in this case, was established just because two persons wanted to become friends. How improbable this sounds without internet, in the complex realities of our time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming to your regret about not talking to them with the same passion in real life, I think here the critical factor being emphasized by you is the emotional content of these acquaintances. That the emotionality of it all is diminishing is what you want to say. But the emotion is just an after-effect. It is not the cause. You become friend with someone because you find something good in them for you and hence better cooperation. That in the end, you develop emotional attachments is just a side-effect in my view. Sometimes these emotions may create a feedback loop and ensure even better cooperation, like two lovers getting married. But unmindful emotions may lead to undesired consequences too, like hyper-nationalists going berserk in their common love for the country. I think, as long as the cause of cooperation is understood well, side-effects like emotions can be controlled or channeled in a better way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Techno-humanism aims to enhance human&apos;s life using technology and binds humanity in a novel way that breaks the shackles of boundaries between nations, religious differences, and any other differences. In this respect at least, social media like facebook, twitter have done well, irrespective of whether it was their motive or not. Traditional relationships which we are most familiar with are undergoing a paradigm shift, and it&apos;s again just a reflection of the changing times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--It is getting long. :P I hope my ramblings did not bore you. Hope to have a wide discussion on it over a cup of tea sometime. :D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What design tells you about the company‚Äôs values&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Facebook and Twitter allow posts to be publicly accessible by people who have not joined the platform. It is good to note that the default setting of Facebook is to be private with posts and Twitter to be open to the web. While managing the Facebook and Twitter account of an organization I am involved in, I noticed a serious design pattern involved in displaying the public posts and their stark differences.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 1&lt;/strong&gt; of interaction consists of the &lt;em&gt;content of the tweet&lt;/em&gt; with the highest visibility, followed by who created the tweet, then more details about the tweet. At this point of time, there is no available ‚ÄúSign Up‚Äù button to be clicked. You can now easily close the tab since most of the times, your purpose would be the information contained in the tweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you feel engaged and you click on the close button on the top right corner, you‚Äôll land on the profile page of the account which created the tweet, which I call the &lt;strong&gt;Stage 2.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see that the majority percentage of the web page is covered with the profile information. On the sidebar and header, there are interactive elements which lead you to sign up on the platform. And you would do, if you seem impressed. Let‚Äôs have a look at Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you open a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/kossiitkgp/photos/a.551030724973932.1073741826.524856034258068/1588200897923571/&quot;&gt;public post&lt;/a&gt; on Facebook, you land on something like this ‚Äî&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs interesting to notice that much more than half of the area is covered with &lt;strong&gt;ways to either join or log in to Facebook&lt;/strong&gt;. And the Stage 1 has &lt;em&gt;zero&lt;/em&gt; information about the post (which was the sole purpose of opening that particular URL). The only way to close this banner is to find that tiny &lt;em&gt;Not Now&lt;/em&gt; text below the big Green &lt;em&gt;Create New Account&lt;/em&gt;. An interesting design flaw (whether intentional or by mistake) is that the typography of &lt;em&gt;Not Now&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Forgotten Account?&lt;/em&gt; is exactly the same, even when the later button is clicked once a hundred times and the former 99 out of 100 times. I think it‚Äôs intentional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs click on &lt;em&gt;Not Now&lt;/em&gt;, and move the &lt;strong&gt;Stage 2&lt;/strong&gt; of the view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äî Facebook‚Äôs main focus is on targeting as many people as they can, while Twitter‚Äôs main focus does not &lt;em&gt;appear&lt;/em&gt; so. Even if both the products want users, Facebook is &lt;strong&gt;desperately user-hungry&lt;/strong&gt; in public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äî Content is not respected on Facebook while Twitter values the content over anything else. Eventually content dies out on Facebook while people keep retweeting and referring 5 year old tweets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/-fFbeSykaJk&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few months ago, a significant percentage of my peers were involved in the process of getting a job or an internship, including me. Some got the &lt;em&gt;success&lt;/em&gt; while some are still trying. But to my astonishment, I found that the degree of comfort in each one of them was not as expected. What I mean by that is, not everyone who got this success was happy, and not everyone who failed was sad, although the majority was skewed on the side of the former case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I broadened my perspective and timeframe, I found that getting a job which pays in money, is not something which can give satisfaction to every human being. We cannot universally advise this to everyone. If you think so, then please understand the gravity of human population on this planet, and my concern was about satisfaction which is difficult to define, since a large part of it loses touch with materialism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I aligned my line of thought with &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;loving the work we do&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. If a farmer spends the day on their field, and they enjoy it, then it‚Äôs good, isn‚Äôt it? How about the software engineer who thinks their technology can help people or maybe due to some other reason, they find love in the code, they write? I found that it was closer to being a ubiquitous activity which can keep people happy, or at least a large number of humans. But then, I saw people who do not have any job at first place. By &lt;em&gt;job&lt;/em&gt;, I mean an activity which benefits people and provides something (&lt;em&gt;e.g. salary&lt;/em&gt;) in return for the individual. But there are wanderers, &lt;em&gt;fakirs&lt;/em&gt;, hitchhikers and many types of &lt;em&gt;unemployed&lt;/em&gt; people. So, are they different from &lt;em&gt;regular&lt;/em&gt;? These people challenged the universality of this line of thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It further gave me an idea that instead of (or along with) loving the work, we also need to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;enjoy with the peers who surround us&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. So, a lot of human beings are embraced by their parents, friends and/or children. It does not happen always, but we can still find some of these in different bandwidths of our life. It reminded me of the letter by Richard Feynman, &lt;a href=&quot;https://fs.blog/2014/08/richard-feynman-what-problems-to-solve&quot;&gt;Do not remain nameless to yourself&lt;/a&gt;. So yeah, Living in love can be a universal thing to do. And it allowed me to picture this massive population of ours on the planet earth. But then, I found exceptions. I thought of Chris McCandless (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Into_the_Wild_%28film%29&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Into the wild&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) and how he did not find love in his family but Nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was back to square one. Do we need another human being to live this life, happily? People can not always surround us. And further, outside of seven billion humans, there are other lives as well. What about dogs, or the trees, plants, and flowers which are alive? Or a lost animal somewhere in the jungle. Do they have to have a peer to share the love or their &lt;em&gt;pursuit of happiness&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My problem set got bigger, and I appreciated &lt;em&gt;how difficult it must be for a democracy to form its constitution&lt;/em&gt; or King Hammurabi to write his &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_Hammurabi&quot;&gt;code&lt;/a&gt;. At this point, I felt a little exhausted in finding the answer to my question (it had been several months by now).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a few days ago, as I was practicing &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vipassan%C4%81#Vipassana-meditation_in_the_modern_Vipassana_movement&quot;&gt;Vipassana Meditation&lt;/a&gt;, I had an epiphany about the question. I realized how much did I miss to observe about my own physical body even when there was so much going on already. I never noticed my breath on its whole (trust me, when I say, I still have not). The moment we start to breathe in, and it goes on for a full length, and then it stops. A moment of no activity, and then we breathe out. And the cycle repeats. Breathing is just one of the many involuntary signs of life, and yet it goes on unnoticed. It made me regard the totality around me, even more. To mention a few, the breeze which blows past me when I stroll on &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.metakgp.org/w/2.2&quot;&gt;2.2&lt;/a&gt;, the distant sound I listen to while typing this text, the leaves which fall off from the trees when I sit with a cup of &lt;em&gt;chai&lt;/em&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.co.in/maps/place/Bhaski%27s/@22.3161081,87.2988514,21z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x3a1d43feddbb1c35:0xeff718f07e02348!8m2!3d22.3159891!4d87.2987071&quot;&gt;Bhaski‚Äôs&lt;/a&gt;, and other many signs of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think, for the question of &lt;em&gt;‚ÄúWhat is something which should be the universal action of everyone?‚Äù&lt;/em&gt;, I can put it in words as ‚Äú&lt;em&gt;To witness‚Äù&lt;/em&gt;. We necessarily do not have to think, question, or react to the activities around us or &lt;em&gt;even inside us&lt;/em&gt;, but to just witness the presence of life. In Sanskrit, we call this state of no-mind as ‡§®‡§ø‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§ø‡§ö‡§æ‡§∞. I felt that generally, we are ignorant of ourselves and we miss to observe a lot. With this awareness and focus, the decisions we make are quite apparent, and we can then work on optimizing our limited time on this planet to do something.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Response to 'How is Life?']]></title><description><![CDATA[I was asked "How is Life?" over chat by someone and I thought of responding with a letter.

&lt;p&gt;I was asked &quot;How is Life?&quot; over chat by someone and I thought of responding with a letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello :name-retracted:,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am sorry it took me so long to respond to you. I was travelling. The same winter vacations, 30 days, and the curiosity of what to do with it. It&apos;s astonishing for the old-me that I have no tech goals this time. I have been learning Guitar for a month and hence I tend to practice daily. On the other hand, I have goals of losing weight (lost 6 kgs in 45 days) and hence I&apos;m determined to maintain the daily calorie deficit. One of my cousin sisters at home (in :place-name-retracted:) gave birth to a little girl yesterday and I&apos;m planning to spend some time with them too! So yeah, this December it&apos;s mostly about being with close people and few goals which I&apos;ve wanted to achieve for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately, my thoughts have been revolving around this particular letter&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.toptal.com/&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; of Feynman. In which he says, &quot;No problem is too small or too trivial if we can really do something about it.&quot;. Reading this letter gives me tremendous relief because it settled down some of my uneasiness about something which relates to KGP itself. The general idea of MetaKGP as a group, for me, is a solution to the problem we have in KGP of closed societies and very little collaborative nature among a majority of people. (Of course, it means more). While I understood this problem very clearly, there is always more which have been troubling me since my first year. I still do not understand all of them, but few are &quot;the troubled hierarchy and senior-junior relationship in our halls and societies&quot; and &quot;lack of human interactions about life and work both&quot;. I always have so many people with whom I am able to talk about technology and so many other people with whom I am able to talk about philosophy, but I only have two or three friends with whom I can freely talk both at the same time, which in fact is the real me. And I always believed, for this to take place, we will have to do more than meeting online. (I am literally shaking at this point but this does not reflect on the words I have written so far. That&apos;s why I love human interactions more, where more senses are at work than just reading text)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point in time in my KGP life, I am certain that it is so much more helpful when you have good seniors with whom you can meet occasionally, curious peers with whom you discuss the questions. I have been blessed to get all of them, the likes of you and :name-retracted:. But this does not happen to everyone. I firmly believe there are people (like me) in my batch, who did not meet enough &lt;em&gt;[insert-an-adjective abstracted by &apos;good&apos;]&lt;/em&gt; seniors (like I met) and now they come around and call a fellow friend &quot;stud&quot; while I just wish to join them and not create boundaries and levels between us. One of them ended his life ten months ago. And there are probably more living with the following thoughts. Just to add, I am absolutely not asking everyone to become a tech guy and get seniors who do open source. Few of the best people I have met in KGP do not belong to tech. And it should be like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BUT, here is an interesting fact. A majority of my friends who are responsible, who try to understand about life, who are really enjoying this journey are associated with Collaborating in groups and/or doing Open Source software. And I believe this has to be one of the solutions for (some) people and could really help them. My motive to create a closed group of people who understand this problem and are willing to help others, the initiative of KWoC, the sessions etc. are just a bigger picture to my very small zeal of increasing more human interactions in KGP. It&apos;s disheartening when a lot of my friends do not understand the efforts or simply do not care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excuse me for some arrangement of words which can be put together in a more readable manner and losing my brevity. But I have not talked about this to anyone, except :name-retracted: and that too only once. It will take time for me to organize these thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, How is life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey,
Thanks a lot for writing this, the pleasure of receiving a letter isn&apos;t something I get often. So, How is life for me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such broad questions are easy to ask and way hard to answer, that&apos;s why I mostly receive the answer &quot;good!&quot;. Right now I&apos;m listening to Blackstratblues, in another tab I have django documentation open which I have to use to complete to order to complete the screening process of Toptal &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.toptal.com/&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, and I have been thinking about ways machine learning is wrong I have attached a writeup. I just finished this book called &quot;The Black Swan&quot; by Nassim N. Taleb you should totally read it, on surface it is about limits of knowledge but I find him to be very profound and his philosophies connect everything in life and universe. He isn&apos;t a I know it all pundit rather he talks about what you don&apos;t know, what you cannot know and what can you do about it. Of course, as with any book and any author you don&apos;t have to agree with everything or even anything the author says but the book will give you a new perspective. I was about to say this perspective is &quot;helpful&quot; then I remembered my own writing on :blogpost-retracted:.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The days just after quitting the job were pretty stressful, my parents even convinced me take back my resignation at one point, but now I&apos;m glad out of it. My biggest fear at job was that I&apos;ll get trapped in it, sure I didn&apos;t like it, I found it to be boring and whatever, but I know myself and I know that I adapt to things slowly as weeks turned into months, months would have turned into years and I would learned to like the job the way it is, extra money, suits, the &quot;prestige&quot; I had started to develop a taste for them. After sometime that fact that this job was something that I never wanted would have faded way and I would have accepted the most boring parts as part of the parcel, thinking what better can I get. Though it might not look that way from outside, quitting the job was REALLY hard for me, in conventional terms it was the best job I could have got, though I was very clear that this job was not something I wanted but the question was if not this then what? I saw no natural transition either, I interviewed with :company-name-retracted: for tech lead and they didn&apos;t take me. One day I was pretty frustrated, I thought if I don&apos;t quit now then I&apos;ll never be able to quit. I thought about the reasons I should stay, none of them were strong enough, so I resigned next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About opensource, I don&apos;t have much to add to add to what you said. Just as you are glad to find us, I&apos;m glad to find you. As you did, sometimes I look back and realize that I have really really lucky. Things would have been way different if I didn&apos;t meet :name-retracted: and :name-retracted: in school, things would have been way different if I, :name-retracted: and :name-retracted: wouldn&apos;t have been my wingies, things would have been way different I hadn&apos;t discovered :name-retracted:&apos;s blog before coming to KGP which lead to me to discover KLUG. There are many many such lucky things which have happened. Of course there are people who are luckier than me, but there are so many others who aren&apos;t. I think it is our responsibility to share this luck so that others can get a chance to get lucky like we did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote this couple of days ago, I wanted to send it to a private chat. But I don&apos;t think I can, so I am sending it here. Of all people at MetaKGP, I surely think I can correspond freely with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello :name-retracted:, :name-retracted: and :name-retracted:!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am writing this specifically for you guys because for me MetaKGP has always been defined by you three. (+ :name-retracted: and Himanshu)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am writing this to talk about my tenure and how I feel about MetaKGP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting from the very start, I always wanted to have a hacker experience. To learn and be someone who could build things to make one&apos;s life easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my first year, I refrained from joining other societies and went only for so-called technical societies, I always thought that we have a limited time and time spent on anything else would cut time given to my aim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then in the second year, being in :hostel-name-retracted:, Me and :name-retracted: found ourselves working together for OpenIIT Data Analytics challenge. I used to complete everything allocated to me. And maybe that&apos;s why :name-retracted: called me for a MetaKGP meetup. I was like damn, there are societies other than the research groups working in tech domain. :name-retracted: had asked me to write on the wiki about JCB, personally, I disliked it. Anyway, I completed it. And then wrote a little more on the wiki (I was copying what everyone was doing), but still the memories I cherished about MetaKGP came from the meetings we had, where we discussed possible projects. (I still think how crazy the idea of a 2.2 bot is.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I saw :name-retracted:&apos;s :project-name-retracted: script, I was astonished how one can create sessions, log in to ERP and automate so many things. :project-idea-retracted:. I had made something of use, not only for me but for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there was a session on sys-admin by :name-retracted:, I tried to learn it, even practiced at room but couldn&apos;t get hold of so many things he talked about. I wouldn&apos;t try to justify myself here but would definitely say that it was my lack of interest that I didn&apos;t give much time to learn it. (At the time I was recently introduced to ML, had mentored the winter workshop on CV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then came the third year, I think there was a phase shift. Suddenly we were focussing a little more on advertising MetaKGP. It is necessary that people get to know about MetaKGP and our projects, but we were focussed more on advertising than creating value. I am not undermining the ongoing projects, Naarad came to completion during this time, MFQP-source was going strong. But during this time only one of current third year told me during the meeting, &quot;Ye meeting me bss fundebaazi chalti rahti hai&quot; (He does not come to meeting now)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then came elections, :name-retracted: asked me and I stood up for contesting. At the same time, Inter-IIT and Inter-Hall OpenSoft were going on, I won&apos;t go into much detail but I was very busy. I wrote my proposal in a train journey and sent it to :name-retracted:, I believed that I was going to lose. Even in the vote, I gave myself lowest priority. But thank god I was chosen as a maintainer, I have learned so many things in my tenure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this also meant that I had to fulfill what I had written in my proposal (Please don&apos;t rebuke on this point, I know it is naive of me to think so), So I started the :slack-channel-name-retracted: channel cause I knew that due to my interest I would read about ML and DL every day and hence posting regularly about it would be easier. And I conducted the :event-name-retracted:, I justified myself that I would get to know how senior people work and think. I learnt a great deal from the :event-name-retracted: but accepting their failure, none of them attracted more people to slack. Most of the people who came to :event-name-retracted: were on my personal invitation, even sharing from GymK page didn&apos;t help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the summers, :name-retracted: had shifted everything to docker, I thought that this is the time that I can learn about docker and maybe help. I tried to install it, fix some issue. I got stuck somewhere and I left. It was frustrating to work on docker, I just accepted defeat that I won&apos;t be of much use for the server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now coming to this year: :name-retracted:, :name-retracted:, :name-retracted:, Himanshu, :name-retracted:, :name-retracted: and :name-retracted:, all of them had been great with me. But we were discussing more and working less. As I have fresh memories for this semester, I can recall that we talked about course reviews but never got them, we talked about a fresher intro we never gave, we talked about myriad things we never did. For me, this clearly shows how I failed as a maintainer. I didn&apos;t criticize anyone, this is not a good practice. I tried to work on projects: the :project-name-retracted:(a naive project), the :project-name-retracted:(it was almost completed, I mean it builds and runs, but as CIC already caches YT it is not of much use). We got traffic for MFQP-source (IMO this was awesome on the part of :name-retracted: and :name-retracted: for getting this feat). I contributed to the wiki, hoped that this might inspire people to contribute more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my experiences, I would try to draw conclusions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was foolish of me to believe that bringing more people on slack would help MetaKGP, Until and unless we create value there won&apos;t be much to bind us. I don&apos;t think we need a lot of people for MetaKGP if we have only 3-5 people from each batch that would be more than enough. We need to promote the Hacker culture in KGP, it doesn&apos;t specifically means promoting MetaKGP. We conducted few small lightning talk session amongst us friends this semester, I learnt a lot from that. We at MetaKGP need to stop branding ourselves as a society for everyone, We are (or have become) a technical society whose people have interest in everything. We need to focus more on projects, we, maintainers, created a small roadmap in our last meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Incomplete and left]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;i-responded--&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#i-responded--&quot; aria-label=&quot;i responded   permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I responded -&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey :name-retracted:,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is hard for me to write the words I am about to. It is hard for me to maintain brevity due to multiple strong emotions attached to the subjects. But here I go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While reading your message, One thing that I felt is best described as Sorry. Yeah. I am sorry I did not support you enough on the cab ride with :name-retracted:, even when I wanted to. I am sorry I did not contest in the elections with you or justified my stance publicly of why not to. I am sorry I mostly acted as if &quot;you are supposed to&quot; and &quot;I might voluntarily&quot; for various tasks, events, and responsibilities. This is not how things work. On one hand, we are trying to get new and enthusiastic people, while at the same time, due to the same actions, MetaKGP is turning other people off, who already existed. I am one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can I tell you something about Kharagpur Winter of Code? :name-retracted: has started growing a bad taste for it. His problem is &quot;Why are we coaching people for GSoC? We should be promoting hardcore Open Source instead.&quot; This is where I differ and agree with him at the same time. Yes, we should be promoting hardcore Open Source. But what would be the perfect strategy? Engineers with jobs, when they have an upfront deadline to ship a product and they need a simple NLP date time parser in Python, they don&apos;t go and write one library, they find it on GitHub, which saves their ass. And thereafter, when they create something useful, they return the favor to open source by maintaining projects like React, Angular, etc. So, the question is, why in this world, would any 18-year-old college student would do such thing? What is the value the kid sees? If you promote hardcore open source, 5 out of 1500 would come and 1 would stay. If you promote Google Summer of Code, 400 out of 1500 would come and 30 would stay. And out of those 30, you can definitely be certain that more than 1 would continue doing open source. So, this is what I said to :name-retracted:, &quot;This is not a model which we invented for KGP, this is a model which Larry Page and Sergey Brin created in 2004. Even they resorted to money, incentives, and glamour to get more students into open source. We are still young, to solve this problem.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my perspectives for MetaKGP is the same. It is trying to help students without giving any sustainable incentive, and hoping they would stick together. No, they won&apos;t. I still go back to the group because I know that some people in there share the same passion for Software as I do. Why are we not working on developing that passion? Why are we not passionate about creating things anymore? Small things, doesn&apos;t matter, but it should be solving the problem of at least one person. Let us do that! Let us empower more beginners to achieve this. Second years like :name-retracted: and &quot;name-retracted: have such bright college life ahead, they do things which less than 1% of their batch would be able to comprehend. This is what we should be doing. And people like :name-retracted: and :name-retracted: are their inspirations when they do these things. The people who inspire them, just don&apos;t know how they are helping others without actually willing to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe the &quot;problem with MetaKGP&quot; began when :name-retracted: misunderstood it. He started believing that promoting MetaKGP will solve all the problems because it represents the core concept of Freedom in software and a war against proprietary things (in this case, closed KGP societies and Hall culture). The concept of being open to everyone and hierarchy, all routed his passion towards promoting MetaKGP. It was hard to argue with him because he had forgotten what it feels to be the first year and knowing rat shit about these technologies and ideas. He had lost the concept of being a guide to juniors long time ago and he became a friend to everyone. Alas, that was never going to solve the issue. Willingly or unwillingly, everyone started spreading &quot;word&quot; about MetaKGP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you read :name-retracted:&apos;s :article-name-retracted: you will find the motive &lt;em&gt;&quot;:exact-words-retracted:&quot;&lt;/em&gt; For me,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaboration comes when we work together to organize a big event, not one person contacting people to come and speak. Collaboration is when someone messages you &quot;I will take care of this&quot;, but you insist on sharing the work because you know they would get exhausted by the amount of work involved and they just said it because they are junior to you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Openness is when we freely respond to juniors and batchmates &quot;Yaar room pe aa ja kabhi bhi; Chal milte hain; Yaha se padh le&quot;. Two days ago, I met 3 unknown juniors from RK. They wished to open a startup of memes. They didn&apos;t know what GET/POST requests are. I told them everything, how they can use MVC, databases, image editing with js, apps, security of servers. I left them with the suggestion, &quot;Don&apos;t do this if you are aiming for users, do this because you want this product to be alive, do it just for the sake of creating it. Users will follow. And even if they don&apos;t, you&apos;ll never regret the fact of creating something.&quot; I spent 2 hours with them and comforted them to approach me anytime in future. I guess that would be openness. I did not add them to KOSS or MetaKGP because it will not help them as of now, and they would probably be a victim of inferiority complex, as a lot of my friends were when I added them to KLUG in my first year. I was different and developed the false belief that this was the correct way and hence it would work for everyone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Self-improvement is when we read a trending article about git, python, (some particular ML algorithm) even if we know so much about it; because we thrive for that last 20-30% we don&apos;t know about it, that particular method or that command. And then we share stuff in places like ShowKGP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Curiosity is asking :name-retracted: &quot;how is work?&quot;, even when your inner self is telling you that you would not get a constructive answer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the :name-retracted:&apos;s :article-name-retracted:, you can find an article about inclusivity - :exact-words-retracted:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, this is a good model. But it will fail when the &quot;we&quot; includes the one &quot;who got into the phase of passive lack of exclusion&quot;. Again, all I am resorting to is that promoting MetaKGP is a positive, attempt at solving a very difficult, abstract and huge problem in college. But no one ever questioned, should we really be doing that right now? For me, there are more existing problems in KGP which needs to be solved and they hold a higher priority. I have spent a lot of my time in KGP at solving those. You surely know all of it, and all of me in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of nowhere, this reminds me of the recent movie Newton. It is a great drama which shows us that there is a limit to the extent of solving a problem and strategizing is very important rather than following the pure true way. If you have watched it, you should remember the crazy scene when Rajkumar Rao holds the gun in his hand. If you haven&apos;t, I can quote a line from the movie &quot;Sir, koi bhi change ek din mein nahi aata. Waqt lagta hai&quot;. I can totally relate to :name-retracted:&apos;s MetaKGP with the lead in the movie, who tries to solve everything instantly by doing it the pure way. Although it solves the problem upto some extent but is completely useless and can be solved in steps, in easier and more sustainable way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been writing this email for a long time now, and I think it can never be completed. I&apos;ll get some tea now and hope to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS. I was listening to Post Rock the whole time. ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks Himanshu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the first place, you don&apos;t need to be sorry for that. This incident has very little correlation to the cab discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have provided a more than verbose level of description, I would say -vv. And it resonates my own view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:some comments on the previous email:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh this mail was such a great relief, few bad things happened these days and then you read a letter like this. I really liked the way you structured the letter, it seems like whatever is written are thoughts which came spontaneously to the mind but analysis which had always been there with ready references. &lt;em&gt;Chuckle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope ki you are going good with the guitar!&lt;/p&gt;

The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren&apos;t special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you&apos;re Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it&apos;s a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let&apos;s do more of those!&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Easiest hello world program in a language without calling any function&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each and every line is the philosophy of Python&apos;s design and is a supreme holy guide&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe just to show that there always should be a new line at the end of a file!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not an easter egg, a joke in the interpreter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It opens this &lt;a href=&quot;https://xkcd.com/353&quot;&gt;xkcd comic&lt;/a&gt; which demonstrates how easy it is to do stuff with modules&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is to instantly close down any conversation about introducing curly braces to Python&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Guido van Rossum is a big fan of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python%27s_Flying_Circus&quot;&gt;Monty Python&apos;s Flying Circus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&apos;s a substitution cipher called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13&quot;&gt;ROT13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In many languages there are two ways to do the same thing &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;--no&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;no--&lt;/code&gt;. The message has a hidden example in itself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support for unicode character set for naming identifiers was added in Python3. Though, it is not explicitly preferred while writing code, it adds flavour to working with scientific formulas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The original code is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Lib/antigravity.py&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://xkcd.com/426/&quot;&gt;xkcd comic&lt;/a&gt; referenced, and maybe that&apos;s why this is also in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;antigravity&lt;/code&gt; module&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0401/&quot;&gt;PEP 401&lt;/a&gt; is an April Fools&apos; Joke - The PEP&apos;s number is 401, i.e. 4/01 or April 1st (April Fools&apos; Day). The PEP states that Guido van Rossum is stepping down. The new title given to him would be pronounced &quot;BDEVIL&quot; (Benevolent Dictator Emeritus Vacationing Indefinitely from the Language) and Guido&apos;s successor will be Barry Warsaw, or as he is affectionately known, Uncle Barry. Uncle Barry&apos;s official title is &quot;FLUFL&quot; (Friendly Language Uncle For Life). There are in-jokes about the Parrot virtual machine and the &quot;non-existent&quot; Python Secret Underground (possibly a throw-back to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_Is_No_Cabal&quot;&gt;&quot;TINC&quot; on USENET&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was reading about &lt;em&gt;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&lt;/em&gt;, a book by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_S._Raymond&quot;&gt;Eric S. Raymond&lt;/a&gt; on various (open source) software development methods. The wikipedia page for the book in short, lists few important lessons that he learned and they can not be more true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer‚Äôs personal itch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to rewrite (and reuse).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plan to throw one [version] away; you will, anyhow. (Copied from Frederick Brooks‚Äô &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_S._Raymond&quot;&gt;The Mythical Man-Month&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have the right attitude, interesting problems will find you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you lose interest in a program, your last duty to it is to hand it off to a competent successor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treating your users as co-developers is your least-hassle route to rapid code improvement and effective debugging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Release_early,_release_often&quot;&gt;Release early. Release often.&lt;/a&gt; And listen to your customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smart data structures and dumb code works a lot better than the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you treat your beta-testers as if they‚Äôre your most valuable resource, they will respond by becoming your most valuable resource.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next best thing to having good ideas is recognizing good ideas from your users. Sometimes the latter is better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often, the most striking and innovative solutions come from realizing that your concept of the problem was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perfection (in design) is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but rather when there is nothing more to take away. (Attributed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_de_Saint-Exup%C3%A9ry&quot;&gt;Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any tool should be useful in the expected way, but a truly great tool lends itself to uses you never expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When writing gateway software of any kind, take pains to disturb the data stream as little as possible‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand never throw away information unless the recipient forces you to!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When your language is nowhere near Turing-complete, syntactic sugar can be your friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A security system is only as secure as its secret. Beware of pseudo-secrets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To solve an interesting problem, start by finding a problem that is interesting to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Provided the development coordinator has a communications medium at least as good as the Internet, and knows how to lead without coercion, many heads are inevitably better than one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar#Lessons_for_creating_good_open_source_software&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Attribution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These lessons are really something to be read periodically while developing and contributing to open source software. They are worth noting down and sharing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[‡§ß‡•Å‡§Ü‡§Ç (Dhuaan)]]></title><description><![CDATA[‚Ä¶]]></description><link>https://orkohunter.net/blog/dhuaan</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://orkohunter.net/blog/dhuaan</guid><pubDate>Sat, 04 Mar 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;‡•ö‡§∞‡•ç‡§¶ ‡§â‡•ú‡§æ‡§§‡•á ‡§â‡§® ‡§™‡§π‡§ø‡§Ø‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§ï‡•ã&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instagram &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; Facebook, but only with a different purpose than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10100933624710391&quot;&gt;connecting people&lt;/a&gt;, it‚Äôs about sharing photos. Photos are great, they convey art, beauty and literature in its own form. And that is what attracted Instagram to so many users. But the problem started when, we applied our *minds to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sharing pictures with your face in it&lt;/strong&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;Couple years ago, if you had clicked a great picture of yours and you wanted to share it among your friends (people who know you), you‚Äôd usually go to Facebook and then share it over there. But what people do now is that they post it on Instagram and then share it over Facebook. This is the most meaningless aspect of Facebook after pokes. Why do you expect someone to see (follow) your photos on Instagram if they do not know you at all? And if they do, you are definitely friends with them on Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Poorly composed pictures clearly showing you having fun&lt;/strong&gt;
Why do people start migrating away from Facebook? This happened when their friends started using Facebook as a &lt;em&gt;PR tool&lt;/em&gt;, to estabilish that they are living a good life, irrespective of the reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, what would happen if you would post your party pictures, your fun trips stories on Instagram? Don‚Äôt they already have enough from you, on Facebook?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quoting Nerdwriter1 here, ‚ÄúBefore posting anything on the social media, think a little about Why you post what you post.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can have all of Flickr, 500px, Imgur on Instagram, with a better and more familiar social network. But like &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.ycombinator.com&quot;&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://reddit.com&quot;&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt; and unlike &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quitfacebookday.com/&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, it is **okay &lt;em&gt;not to&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;post,&lt;/em&gt; but just consume the beauty out of it. So, put the peer pressure off and enjoy following &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.creativebloq.com/photography/instagram-2131996&quot;&gt;some amazing photographers&lt;/a&gt; on Instagram. And hey, it‚Äôs perfectly cool if you share your photography skills over there too¬†! It‚Äôs a social network after all. And it‚Äôs also alright if you click a cute picture of a child you spotted in a village. It‚Äôs great. Likeways, it‚Äôs okay if you post a picture of your own child. Or your spouse. Or your own. Hey wait, maybe I should watch the video again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**It‚Äôs okay to post a picture of a Human (and it‚Äôs not the same)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that I don‚Äôt actually hate my friends on instagram. It‚Äôs just a momentary disgust, which vanishes away when I hangout with these amazing people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writwick Wraj loves using the command line.
Writwick googles ‚ÄúHow to do X in terminal?‚Äù and multiple forums and blog posts finally provide him the magical &lt;em&gt;command&lt;/em&gt; for the rescue. Problem Solved¬†!
Fast forward couple weeks, Writwick has to do X in terminal, again. Wraj remembers solving this few weeks ago. Let him do a reverse-i-search with &lt;em&gt;Ctrl+R&lt;/em&gt;. Nope, can‚Äôt remember sh*t. Browser search history? 25 web pages found matching *X*. Argh!
Writwik finally finds the solution. From this time Writwik starts writing the commands somewhere online for the future.
Wait, why shouldn‚Äôt he keep the command in his terminal itself if this is only place where he‚Äôll ever have use it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/f1944495e4b7f20b8ca279cc8e4d8d2d/1*A4bHZhazEzT2giYA-djLmA.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introducing a new command line tool which solves the issue of memorizing commands or storing them somewhere which is difficult to find. With the grep and run commands, one can easily find their long forgotten commands and use them them right away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If not already, use keep register to create a database of your commands on the Keep remote. You can push and pull the commands from any of your computers. This comes handy when we are in our ssh sessions, and all we‚Äôve got at our disposal, is a shell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is about how I maintain the space &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/OrkoHunter/mfdf/blob/master/fortunes&quot;&gt;https://github.com/OrkoHunter/mfdf/blob/master/fortunes&lt;/a&gt;fortune is a Unix program which chooses a random message from its database of quotations and displays in the Shell. There are mainly three types of the quotations; literature, fortunes and riddles. I once tried adding fortune in my ~/.zshrc file so that a new fortune would appear whenever I create a new terminal session. There are many other places for making it appear e.g. Login, Logout, XScreenSaver, etc. However, I later went for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;fortune | cowsay -f tux&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cowsay is another program which takes a string and displays in a balloon over acat figure. Note that both of them have to be installed (using apt-get).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we start, make sure you have an account on GitHub. Go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/&quot;&gt;https://github.com&lt;/a&gt;. Pick a username, enter your email id and choose a password. Next, choose &lt;em&gt;unlimited personal repositories for free&lt;/em&gt;. In the final step you can give some input to github and voila¬†! You are now a github user. (If you are redirect from KWoC, use the username there.) There is plethora of git guides over internet, some are really good and some really suck. I here am writing a simple blog for the newbies who have successfully made an account over github and are really excited about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GitHub&lt;/strong&gt; is a web-based Git repository hosting service, which offers some of the distributed revision control and source code management(SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. Unlike Git, which is strictly a command-line tool, GitHub provides a web-based graphical interface and desktop as well as mobile integration&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or simply&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Github connects you with other people who are interested in sharing and creating together.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there are really two ways to begin with. Here goes the first one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a repository¬†: Repository is what you call the stuff you are going to upload and work on. Go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/new&quot;&gt;https://github.com/new&lt;/a&gt; and create a repository. Let‚Äôs name it hello-world.¬†
Add some description, or you might want to add it later. Initialize it with a Readme. It&apos;s a good practice and let&apos;s you clone it immediately. (Yeah right, see below)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clone it¬†: Open your console, move to the directory where you want to work and do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ git clone https://github.com/username/hello-world.git&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will create a directory in your computer. Now, this isn‚Äôt a simple directory. It is a ‚Äòclone‚Äô of the github repository. You can say that the files in it are controlled by the version control system git and tracked with the repository on github. Note¬†: If you have not installed git, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do this,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ cd hello-world
$ git remote -v
origin https://github.com/&amp;lt;username&gt;/hello-world.git (fetch)
origin https://github.com/&amp;lt;username&gt;/hello-world.git (push)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shows that the link to repository of yours at github is known by the name origin over here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, you will have to configure your name and your email address which you will be using for making the commits (don‚Äôt worry about what it means right now, we will cover it soon). This configuring is ideally done only once in a lifetime of your system (or unless you purposely remove your ~/.gitconfig file but that‚Äôs the story of another time).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ git config --global user.name &quot;ABC XYZ&quot;
$ git config --global user.email &quot;abc@xyz.com&quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now another way of this is first you create the directory on your computer. Navigate inside it and do&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ git init&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will initialize an empty git repository inside it. Later, you can add the link to the repository by the git remote command like this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ git remote add origin https://github.com/&amp;lt;username&gt;/hello-world&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can always use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;git remote -v&lt;/code&gt; command to track the aliases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making the first change¬†: Okay now we are in condition of adding some files or code to this repository. I am going to make a python file with hello world program and publish the change over the github repository too.¬†
So make a new file say hello.py inside the directory, open it with your favorite editor and write the one line code to print whatever you want. Why just hello world? (Because dmr did it!) Now write it and save the file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing you should always do is to see whether you have done any changes or not in the repository. This can be done by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ git status&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the changes you made, you must be getting this after git status&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;On branch master
 Your branch is up-to-date with &apos;origin/master&apos;.
 Untracked files:
 (use &quot;git add &amp;lt;file&gt;...&quot; to include in what will be committed)
 hello.py
 nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use &quot;git add&quot; to track)Add, Commit, Push! : In your console, do this.

$ git add .&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This adds all the files in the track which you have changed.¬†
Now it‚Äôs time to commit that change. By committing, git understands that you want the change to be in record. Every commit is accompanied with a message that appears on the log (git log). A commit should represent one logical change only which should be supported by a relevant commit message. The convention is to write the commit in the verbal form ie. tell the computer to do that for you. Do this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ git commit -m &quot;add hello.py&quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You‚Äôve made your first commit! But it won‚Äôt be appearing over github, because you made the changes locally. You need to push it over the web. For that, you use&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ git push&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ git push origin&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to say git where actually you are pushing it to. Or,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ git push origin master&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to say git over what branch on origin you are pushing it to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That‚Äôs it! You‚Äôve published your changes to your GitHub repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE¬†: This is a very basic start. There are more concepts to be explored. You can search for specifics. StackOverflow also has great resources. We‚Äôll leave the nitty gritties of Git for another day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Coding!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[‡§Ü‡§Ç‡§∏‡•Å‡§ì‡§Ç ‡§ï‡•á ‡§¨‡§ø‡§Ç‡§¨ ‡§∏‡•á ‡§õ‡§≤‡§ï‡§§‡•Ä ‡§π‡•Å‡§à ‡§¶‡•Å‡§®‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ, ‡§¶‡•á‡§ñ‡•Ä ‡§•‡•Ä ‡§Æ‡•à‡§Ç‡§®‡•á ‡§è‡§ï ‡§¨‡§æ‡§∞]]></title><description><![CDATA[‚Ä¶]]></description><link>https://orkohunter.net/blog/aanshuon-ke-bimb-se</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://orkohunter.net/blog/aanshuon-ke-bimb-se</guid><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jan 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;‡§Ü‡§Ç‡§∏‡•Å‡§ì‡§Ç ‡§ï‡•á ‡§¨‡§ø‡§Ç‡§¨ ‡§∏‡•á ‡§õ‡§≤‡§ï‡§§‡•Ä ‡§π‡•Å‡§à ‡§¶‡•Å‡§®‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ, ‡§¶‡•á‡§ñ‡•Ä ‡§•‡•Ä ‡§Æ‡•à‡§Ç‡§®‡•á ‡§è‡§ï ‡§¨‡§æ‡§∞&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still remember the day when you first came in this house. You were inside the groceries bag which was kept on the floor right near my table. Ah! 36 aayi, 36 gayi but I never saw anyone like you. Your lean appearance, your light pink complexion and above of all, your aroma all blew up my mind. It took me only 8.2 seconds to realise that I was in love with you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best incident of my life was yet to happen. I seemed to fall off when *Ramu kaka *took you out from the bag and placed you so close to me. I was breathing heavy. I felt as if a high voltage pulse entered me. I could notice all your features. Neck like a swan or even more beautiful, those elegant lips and yes, those tiny eyes, oh! I was feeling dizzy. For long you weren‚Äôt noticing me, maybe because I was not turned on. Thank god! Within few minutes the power was back and I lit myself as intense as I could. I felt more happy than I was before, more alive than I was ever. You had made an impact on me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, our eyes met! I never felt so boozed up before then. Couple of my heartbeats were skipped. I was losing balance over the amount of current I was intaking. That made me fluctuate before you which would have hurt your eyes. But you kept looking at me or I should say I was getting nervous. Were you in love too? Did you like me too? But very soon you were carried away in the kitchen. You left me confused. And the sad part is, I never saw you even once since then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, tonight it‚Äôs going to be the last night in my house. 3 days ago, our madam took a picture of me. I didn‚Äôt know why. Today I got to know that, I was sold, on OLX! Somebody will take me away in the morning. I hope to see you for the last time when I‚Äôll be going. And for now, I‚Äôm going to think about you all the night!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love you forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yours and only yours,¬†

Due to my recent interests in Image Processing, I had made few Pull Requests to the scikit-image library‚Ä¶]]></description><link>https://orkohunter.net/blog/gsoc2016-report</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://orkohunter.net/blog/gsoc2016-report</guid><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jan 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It began 5 months ago, in February. Due to my recent interests in Image Processing, I had made &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3AOrkoHunter+is%3Aclosed&quot;&gt;few&lt;/a&gt; Pull Requests to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image&quot;&gt;scikit-image&lt;/a&gt; library, but it did not participate in GSoC. And that, after all those years of consecutive partcipation! (Yes I felt little sad.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the day when Google announced the list of organizations, I started my ‚Äúorg hunt‚Äù¬†! And by the end of the day, I had sorted out the Python-only projects, which included the project &lt;a href=&quot;http://timelabtechnologies.com/ideas.html&quot;&gt;Library of Time Series methods&lt;/a&gt;. The project was to make a library with methods useful to the research in X-ray astronomy. I was thrilled by the idea! Nevertheless, I was not much aware of the astronomical aspects of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In next 10‚Äì15 days, I submitted my proposal and few Pull Requests, among which I think &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray/pull/74&quot;&gt;refactoring the Lightcurve class&lt;/a&gt; helped me understand the core of the library. In the pre-GSoC period, I also contributed in establishing Continuous Integration with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray/pull/51&quot;&gt;Travis&lt;/a&gt; for Unix and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray/pull/63&quot;&gt;Appveyor&lt;/a&gt; for Windows. Meanwhile, Stingray, the library we were working on, was re-designed to become an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray/pull/52&quot;&gt;Astropy affiliated package&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the wee hours of April 23, the results were announced and I &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5755858201870336&quot;&gt;selected&lt;/a&gt;! My primary and helping mentors were &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dhuppenkothen&quot;&gt;Daniela Huppenkothen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/matteobachetti&quot;&gt;Matteo Bachetti&lt;/a&gt;, both from different time zones, which really helped me in getting my answers as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first ten days of the Community Bonding period, my end semester exams were going on. The main medium of the communication between my mentors and me was Slack. And I must say, we totally loved it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started off with implementing &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-spectrum&quot;&gt;Cross Spectra&lt;/a&gt;, basing to a lot of work that was previously done by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/abigailStev&quot;&gt;Abigail Stevens&lt;/a&gt;. Later on, Coherence and Lags were added in the Crossspectrum class, along with their tests and docstring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the mid-terms the major work was to add the Covariance spectra, and its ‚ÄúAveraged‚Äù counter part as well, along with errors for both. My final PR was to add the simple matrix of Dynamical Powerspectrum, which is open as of now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout this period, I was able to open &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3AOrkoHunter+is%3Aclosed&quot;&gt;22 Pull requests&lt;/a&gt; and push &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray/commits/master?author=OrkoHunter&quot;&gt;116 commits&lt;/a&gt; to the main repository &lt;em&gt;i.e.&lt;/em&gt; StingraySoftware/Stingray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that I would like to share, of many things which I learnt in this perioid, is that numpy booleans are little tricky. For e.g.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;In []: np.isfinite(100) is True
Out[]: False&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is because np.isfinite or similar functions do not return the basic Python bool but an instance of numpy bool. And in the __eq__ magic method of the numpy bool class, it is evaluated to the Python booleans. And so, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;np.isfinite(100) == True&lt;/code&gt; would return True.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is all for now. It was a great experience for me, and I am very thankful to Daniela, Matteo and Abigail for all the help during the summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Erotomania : An Unfortunate Tale]]></title><description><![CDATA[‚ÄúHey Wake up!

&lt;p&gt;Wake up, for you are left with just 30 more minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You better sleep after this is over; rather that would be your only choice. Just 30 minutes later, when the crescent rays will fall on the black hood covering your face, when you‚Äôll be tied with, or rather ‚Äúin‚Äù a knot, for the second time of your life, believe me you would not want to be in haste. You don‚Äôt want them to see your eyes popped out, or your filthy tongue stuck out like a creep right? So, get up, go get your hair combed, your teeth cleaned, and most importantly collect as much happy thoughts as possible in your stupid brain.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only child of his parents, this kid was a loner, an antisocial introvert who liked to stay back in his shady living-slash-playing room, and wished to stay there for lifetime. Skipping school since the fourth grade, his mother very well accepted his social awkwardness as well as his mind‚Äôs disability and was happy with hiding it from the rest of the world. Whilst I, I watched him grow, I kept calling out for him, in his good times, or bad. I lived in him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he was 10, his mother was relocated to a new place, around 50 kilometres from the capital, a place where neighbourhood was as far as the corner shop in the hometown. He was terrified. He had to greet the visitors all along. It was then, he met his first friend, a girl. After she came into his life, there was no shady place, in his house, or heart or anywhere. &lt;em&gt;‚ÄòI love when Vaidehi blinks and smiles at the same time‚Äô&lt;/em&gt;, he‚Äôd say to his mom. One day, it was evident to him, that Vaidehi had the most beautiful eyes he‚Äôd ever seen. I still remember how his mother must have felt when she would have realised that his son had one more best friend now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His mother was long gone before he‚Äôd even think of proposing Vaidehi to marry. It was the same girl, the only girl he‚Äôd ever spoken two words to. He left his mother‚Äôs house and starting living with her at a completely new place. &lt;em&gt;‚ÄòI‚Äôve kept your lunch in the kitchen, heat it carefully, okay? I‚Äôll be back by 7&apos;&lt;/em&gt;, she used to say every morning to him, like a mother warning his kid before herself going out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from his ‚Äúwork from home‚Äù job, he was passionate about clicking pictures. Or rather, he liked to save the moments he was enjoying with her. Some days, he used to shuffle between them, recollect the memories, shed a few tears, curl up on the bed and just wait for her to come in the evening. He was also good at dodging off important calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best were the college days, when he started perceiving how real, the real world was. He was afraid on the first day. Four years later, he had a job, a ‚Äúwork from home‚Äù job, a girlfriend, and no family. But he had learnt how to ignore bullies and be in love, or at least that‚Äôs what he‚Äôd think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚ÄòCome in the City Hospital ASAP. Your wife is here.‚Äô&lt;/em&gt; Some lady spoke on the phone. The call was from Vaidehi‚Äôs number. He rushed out, alone in the traffic and around so many people. He was little mad at her, why she didn‚Äôt take time off work during her last months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚ÄòIt‚Äôs a baby girl‚Äô&lt;/em&gt;, The nurse announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚ÄòLet‚Äôs call her Gayatri‚Äô&lt;/em&gt;, Vaidehi said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚ÄòThat‚Äôs a beautiful name‚Äô&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚ÄòIt‚Äôs your mother‚Äôs.‚Äô&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚ÄòOh yes. Of course.‚Äô&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;‚ÄòAccording to the evidences presented by the accused himself and his self-admittance, the suspect, on charge of murdering his wife and his baby child, is hereby sentenced to be hanged till death on the month‚Äôs last day at sunrise. May God have mercy upon his soul.‚Äô&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was drunk. One day, when she came home. Or maybe high, he could not figure, he remembers, during college days, she had mentioned one of her female friend who was into heroin at those times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaidehi‚Äôs call history. Her friend‚Äôs name in recent calls. She was definitely high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He could not dare speak a word to her. He made sure the little girl is fast asleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She started abusing herself on daily basis. He was worried. He considered himself to be at fault. Maybe, she was not enjoying with him as much as he was. Maybe she didn‚Äôt love him like he did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚ÄòNah! That can‚Äôt be it.‚Äô&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gayatri got into kinder garden. More house chores. Vaidehi couldn‚Äôt find time to visit her friend these days. She did go to work, but usually cut short her work hours in the evening. She was not happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚ÄòI will make her feel good.‚Äô&lt;/em&gt; Maybe one more kid? Maybe pregnancy will stop her from drugs? He knew if he‚Äôll ask her, she would politely refuse or unwillingly agree considering her husband‚Äôs wish. Let it be an accident. Months passed, he started worrying. Nothing happened. How about a medical check-up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚ÄòI‚Äôm sorry sir, but you are infertile‚Äô&lt;/em&gt;, the doc said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within seconds, the first face to appear in front of him, was of his cute little daughter, Gayatri.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Call history. Her friend‚Äôs name is still there. Ring, ring. &lt;em&gt;‚ÄòHello?‚Äô&lt;/em&gt;, a hoarse voice; shocked to the bottom of his hearts. It was of a man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is about the night, the night he became the ‚Äúaccused‚Äù. Vaidehi was chopping off vegetables in the kitchen. He was looking at Gayatri, smiling, wondering. He could not hold any longer. He sneaked in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚ÄòHey‚Äô&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;_‚ÄôSorry I got late, had lots of pending work at office. Dinner would be ready soon. I‚Äôm preparing noodle soup and rice. _&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚ÄòI had to talk to you about something. I am sorry.‚Äô&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She stopped. &lt;em&gt;‚ÄòWhat happened?‚Äô&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚ÄòI am sorry, I checked your email.‚Äô&lt;/em&gt; His heartbeat racing fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚ÄòWhy the fuck would you do that?! And so what?‚Äô&lt;/em&gt;. She put the knife back on the table and stepped towards him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚ÄòI saw the notice from your office. They said you haven‚Äôt showed up in two weeks.‚Äô&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was Numb. His legs were trembling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚ÄòVaidehi, you love me right?‚Äô&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚ÄòYes‚Äô&lt;/em&gt;, her lips were straight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He went straight to bed. Later that morning he woke up, to find himself alone. She was gone with Gayatri. The knife had cut real deep. It was a bloody mess. He fainted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúWhat type of a person you are! That woman had no love for you, but why are you still doing this for her? Just go home already.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thick rope got around his neck. Eyes closed, hood on, memories started flashing in. And then came the regret, the regret that he would have loved Gayatri more, both of them.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Losing and Re-Gaining trust on .gitignore]]></title><description><![CDATA[I would like to share an interesting story of a problem which I‚Äôve faced many times since I started using git.

This story is about ‚Äúlosing and re-gaining trust on¬†.gitignore‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Event¬†:&lt;/strong&gt; Create a Python app. Run it, test it and Boom! Now it‚Äôs time to push it to GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;git init .
git remote add https://github.com/iamsosmart/notsomuch.git
git push -u origin master&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shit, Shit, Shit¬†! I wasn‚Äôt supposed to push the pyc&lt;/em&gt; files. Oh this looks so lame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you‚Äôre amateur enough, not to feel uncomfortable after pushing those files, you‚Äôre golden. Else, you‚Äôll think of something called¬†.gitignore which helps in ignoring unwanted files to be added in your git repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You‚Äôll then search for a good gitignore file for Python and Google will give you exactly what you want, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Python.gitignore&quot;&gt;Python.gitignore&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;wget -O .gitignore https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/master/Python.gitignore
git add -A
git commit -m &quot;Added .gitignore file&quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, you‚Äôll try to remove the pyc files, using rm -rf *.pyc. But as soon as you&apos;ll do this, (and if you&apos;re using oh-my-zsh), you&apos;ll see a cross on your prompt. That means, git has &lt;em&gt;detected&lt;/em&gt; a change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But wait? Why is git detecting changes to pyc files, when I‚Äôve already added the gitignore!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if you‚Äôre me, you‚Äôll feel betrayed by git. You‚Äôll make a few calls and send messages to people, and say &lt;em&gt;‚Äúgitignore is not obeying me‚Äù&lt;/em&gt;, and they‚Äôll hang up on you, saying &lt;em&gt;‚Äúit must be your fault‚Äù&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believe me, even the ‚Äúfuture me‚Äù would have said the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the problem is that once you have staged a file, gitignore won‚Äôt have anything to do with it. So, if you‚Äôll remove the staged file (pyc files, in this case), git will say to you that you‚Äôve deleted them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later on, I googled the string ‚Äúgitignore not working‚Äù and O thanks to stackoverflow, I was rescued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After adding the¬†.gitignore, simply do this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;git rm -rf --cached .
git add .&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, instead of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;rm -rf *.pyc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;, I must have done&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;git rm -rf *.pyc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ta-da¬†! And that‚Äôs when, my friends, the trust I have in git‚Äôs simplicity increased by a tini-tiny bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a python script is compiled, it generates compiled code as pyc files, also called byte code.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[‡§∞‡§æ‡§®‡•Ä (Rani)]]></title><description><![CDATA[Dedicated to all the nameless young girls out there in our villages‚Ä¶]]></description><link>https://orkohunter.net/blog/rani</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://orkohunter.net/blog/rani</guid><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jan 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dedicated to all the nameless young girls out there in our villages&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I have been studying a good amount of complicated Mathematics. I usually lose my temper studying my other subjects like Environmental Science, Biology and Economics. For how long will I have to study ‚Äúeverything‚Äù. Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I either eat or surf the web when I‚Äôm not studying. That‚Äôs pretty much it. I received an email from the Central Library of my college that a book which I had issued very long time ago (and never read, of course) has been over due and I will have to pay fine in case of further delay. Aargh! I had to do it first thing in the morning! I was wired into my laptop. I didn‚Äôt want to get up and set the alarm in my phone or even on Google now. I wanted it right from my terminal. I wasted another half an hour finding such a thing but couldn‚Äôt find the one I was exactly looking for. (Duh! I could have set the alarm by then.). So, after some research and a lot of motivation, I created a repository on github and started my work. I had no idea how was I going to tackle command line executions, Natural Language Processing or anything but I had to make one thing possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ ping-me to go to library tomorrow morning&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one line terminal (english?) command should set the reminder for me on all of my personal devices. Peace!¬†:)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve shared the code here‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/OrkoHunter/ping-me&quot;&gt;https://github.com/OrkoHunter/ping-me&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven‚Äôt written the engine write now. I have bookmarked a lot a sites related to NLP. I‚Äôll continue with them in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My second toy project in the meantime came out to be &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;keep&lt;/code&gt;. I usually don‚Äôt remember shell commands but I need them the most in ssh sessions. I‚Äôm also sick of googling for the same code everytime, I needed to store them somewhere in the computer, using the terminal only‚Ä¶And Ta-da! It‚Äôs working! &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/OrkoHunter/keep&quot;&gt;https://github.com/OrkoHunter/keep&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and yes, I used python for all of the things above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Coding¬†!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Why is Sublime Text not something to be frowned upon?]]></title><description><![CDATA[There have been people, advisers, and more people, enlightening the fact about ‚Äúreal programmers‚Äù, they use emacs or vim. ‚ÄòI use sublime‚Ä¶]]></description><link>https://orkohunter.net/blog/sublime-text</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://orkohunter.net/blog/sublime-text</guid><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jan 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;There have been people, advisers, and more people, enlightening the fact about ‚Äúreal programmers‚Äù, &lt;em&gt;they use emacs or vim&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚ÄòI use sublime text‚Äô&lt;/em&gt;, is often misunderstood as &lt;em&gt;‚ÄòI am a novice and I don‚Äôt like pure black window‚Äô.&lt;/em&gt; There is no way this 7 years old editor is going to compete with 39 years old emacs and 15 years old fork of yet another 39 years old editor vi. Nevertheless, there‚Äôs much more to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing that Sublime Text lovers say about vim and emacs is &lt;em&gt;‚ÄúWhy should I open an editor which I don‚Äôt know how to get out of?‚Äù&lt;/em&gt; Fair enough. They are not mere text editors. They have built-in code to edit any external code. Isn‚Äôt that pretty? Well, you have to follow some steps to close it. (Or you can forcefully shut down your console anytime you want. No matter they are powerful, you belong to the human race.) They also have more powerful features which make its user‚Äôs life easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before you‚Äôll think of your easy life, they‚Äôll make you hate your life first. As &lt;a href=&quot;https://pascalprecht.github.io/&quot;&gt;Pascal Precht&lt;/a&gt; in one of his blogs discuss about the learning curve wall of vim. Here is a picture which is very explanatory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next argument by emacs users are &lt;em&gt;‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt like using touchpad and want everything right there in our editor, like mail, news, everything!‚Äù&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are great sir! But let me also tell you, you are rare and have wrong conclusion about sublime users. We aren‚Äôt fond of touchpad either! As of me, I survived a whole semester of college with &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.orkohunter.net/touchpad-problem-with-asus-laptop-on-linux/&quot;&gt;my touchpad not working&lt;/a&gt;. But that doesn‚Äôt mean I moved to emacs or vim. subl to open, pgup pgdn and arrow keys for navigation, ctrl + s to save, ctrl + t for new tab, I mean I had got everything done with my keyboard and the fact is that Chrome also obeys these commands (or vice-versa). Imagine you scrolling through a webpage and wondering why j and k are not helping you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point I‚Äôm trying to make is why shouldn‚Äôt we encourage newbies to use the editor which makes their life really easy very fast so that they could simply learn how to code rather then learning how to code to code. Later on, let them decide whether they really dislike this editor and move on to something more challenging and I believe some people will surely move on to the challenging ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I will surely not. I‚Äôll wait for the day when I‚Äôll get tired of putting my hands on something so beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[‡§Æ‡§∏‡§æ‡§® (Masaan)]]></title><description><![CDATA[‚Ä¶]]></description><link>https://orkohunter.net/blog/masaan</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://orkohunter.net/blog/masaan</guid><pubDate>Thu, 24 Nov 2016 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;‡§§‡§∏‡§µ‡•ç‡§µ‡•Å‡§∞ ‡§∏‡•á ‡§â‡§∏‡§ï‡•á ‡§π‡•Ä&lt;/p&gt;

Today, as I woke up at 8:30, nothing replaced my butter bread breakfast combination. And when I checked my facebook, it reminded me that today is Diwali! So, &lt;em&gt;&quot;Happy Diwali friends&quot;&lt;/em&gt; is going to be my status too, as if just to tell &apos;em that I am celebrating too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best thing is that even today happiness is alive. But the meaning is not the same. Earlier it was mainly because of the fest, today it&apos;s because of the one day holiday it rendered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve made phone calls to my elder ones, touched their feet and received valuable suggestions to burn the crackers carefully. I know Dada ji had said exactly the same words somewhat 12 years ago. Who knows in advance that the childhood Diwali are the best ones we ever see in life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here at IIT Kharagpur, we have something called Illumination on Diwali. More than a thousand diyas are used by a single hostel to create amazing designs. Here are some of their pictures. That&apos;s the only exciting thing I&apos;m feeling about this Diwali.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;As there is so much light outside, I don&apos;t feel the need of putting any diya. As there is so much noise inside, I don&apos;t feel the need of burning any cracker.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
