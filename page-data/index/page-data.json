Aldous Huxley wrote a dystopian classic called Brave New World, which is contemporary to 1984 and has a similar literary significance. Although Huxley is slightly less familiar, I have come to realize.</p>\n<p>Both Huxley and Orwell talked about dyspotian futures. Although the path leading up to their fearful vision of world were treaded from different ends.</p>\n<p>\"What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no-one who wanted to read one.\"</p>\n<p>\"Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egotism.\"</p>\n<p>\"In 1984, people are controlled by inflicting pain. In Brave New World, they are controlled by inflicting pleasure.\", writes Neil Postman.</p>\n<p>Reading this with the context of Social Media and News in our present world, we are so much closer to the world Huxley envisioned almost hundred years ago.</p>\n<p>However, this blog post isn't about dystopia. I want to talk a bit about this other masterpiece Huxley wrote called \"The Doors of Perception\". It is a tiny book, just about 30 pages; but is top shelf for me.</p>\n<h2>The Doors of Perception</h2>\n<p>Huxley says that no two human beings have the same perception of the world. We perceive things around us uniquely. For example, it doesn't matter how close we feel to a person, let it be our partner, a close friend of ours or our parents - each of our perceptions will always be different. And it gets interesting if you think more about it.</p>\n<p>\"We live together, we act on, and react to, one another; but always and in all circumstances we are\nby ourselves. The martyrs go hand in hand into the arena; they are crucified alone. Embraced, the lovers desperately try to fuse their insulated ecstasies into a single self-transcendence; in vain. By its very nature every embodied spirit is doomed to suffer and enjoy in solitude. Sensations, feelings, insights, fancies - all these are private and, except through symbols and at second hand, incommunicable. We can pool information about experiences, but never the experiences themselves. From family to nation, every human group is a society of island universes...\", says Huxley in this book.</p>\n<h2>Reality</h2>\n<p>If someone asks me - what do you mean by reality? I'll say, well, you know the trees grow, flowers bloom, we live on planet Earth, which is round, human beings experience pain and suffering, gravity exists - and the other things that I see in the world.</p>\n<p>In my answer, I only mentioned what is easy for me to say, and can be agreed upon by a lot of people - hopefully everyone. But my complete reality is much larger and has edges which get a bit fuzzier. And I have not grown enough to describe them well, I think. I probably never will.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"What we ordinarily call \"reality\" is merely that slice of total fact which our biological equipment, our linguistic heritage and our social conventions of thought and feeling make it possible for us to apprehend.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These words of Huxley are painful to read at times. He basically suggests that we'll never know the <em>absolute reality</em> even if it exists. The tool that helps us cut this \"slice\" is called Perception.</p>\n<p>But the good news is that our perceptions change, or rather expand. And we get to see more of it as we grow.</p>\n<h2>Experiences</h2>\n<p>Huxley says that for each of us, there are many perceptions which we can not access. Their doors are locked for us. For example, if you never given birth, you can still talk about parenting but there is so much more still locked for you. And you'll get to unlock that <em>door</em> only when you will raise a child.</p>\n<p>He says that we are caged inside our perceptions, and that there are doors which lead us to new realities. But so far we have opened only a handful of them. And majority of doors are still locked for us - and that too from outside - so it's not possible for us to go and see what's on the other side merely by <em>thinking</em>.</p>\n<p>It takes experiences - or rather \"meaningful experiences\" to unlock these doors.</p>\n<h2>Communication</h2>\n<p>My university campus was beautiful. The trees and the shades of green always blew my mind. Taking frequent walks in the day was one of my favorite activities. For a few years, I thought everyone around me knew it - just because it was obvious for me.</p>\n<p>After reading Huxley and The Doors of Perception, I entered a brief but gloomy phase in life. He basically gave me some uncomfortable realizations that I had to live with. No matter how much I love my parents or my partner, they will never get to know it all. A part of me was getting sadder with more experiences I was having one by one. And it was getting harder for me to communicate <em>everything</em> I felt. I was naive.</p>\n<p>Years have passed and I have made peace with this limitation of life. We can not communicate everything, but we can try! Since then, I started putting more effort into the ways I communicate. Sometimes I speak, write poems, draw analogies from stories - and sometimes I would just send someone a song. I have made peace with the fact that everything can not be conveyed with language. Some things need to be heard, seen and felt.</p>\n<p>Same goes for taking pictures. Don't get me wrong - I think photos are a great way of communicating. But sometimes I respect a view, by not taking a picture. How would you feel if someone took a favorite song of yours, and sang it poorly and offbeat? The same goes for me when I try to capture extraordinary beauty of nature in pixels. It usually happens with mountains, forests, oceans, etc.</p>\n<h2>Art is an attempt to communicate</h2>\n<p>Art (poetry, music, paintings etc.) are beautiful attempts by human beings to convey their perceptions. Even though I will never get to think about music, the way David Gilmour of Pink Floyd did. I will never get to think about world, the way Aldous Huxley did. I will never look at the stars in the sky, the way Van Gogh did. But their music, writings and paintings hints me of a larger reality.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Realizing that the true nature of reality is beyond our comprehension and that we'll always be cutting slices of it, can be a humbling feeling. It can inspire us to keep expanding our perceptions - by have more meaningful experiences in life.</p>","timeToRead":4}},{"node":{"id":"4963037f-04cb-58ef-97d6-c862e2225448","frontmatter":{"categories":["Tech"],"date":"Dec 2020","draft":false,"slug":"/blog/why-do-open-source-in-college","subtitle":"If you are planning to stay close to Software after graduation, this article might win you over to do Open Source.","summary":"If you are planning to stay close to Software after graduation, this article might win you over to do Open Source.","title":"Why should one do Open Source in college?"},"html":"<blockquote>\n<p>If you are planning to stay close to Software after graduation, this article might win you over to do Open Source.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>More and more students are now being involved with Open Source programming. Thanks to programs like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code\">Google Summer of Code</a> who have seriously changed the lives of many and introduced hundreds of thousands of young students to Open Source programming.</p>\n<p>However, this number is small in the grand scheme of things.</p>\n<p>If I have to make a guess, out of all the students who graduate and start their career around Software (including Data Science, Machine Learning, etc.), less than 10% would ever contribute to any Open Source projects. And even less would do so for an extended period of time.</p>\n<p>In this blog post, I am writing down some reflections. I am highlighting few major reasons why I feel open source contributions are helpful. And the benefits are extraordinary.</p>\n<h2>You learn so much more</h2>\n<p>Almost all of your Pull Requests will be reviewed by other people. In a healthy open source community, maintainers spend a big chunk of their time reviewing incoming Pull Requests. There are many times when review comments leave me in awe - and I am filled with gratitude. The reviewer wants to have good quality code in the software, but in effect of that, you learn so much more from their insights and experience.</p>\n<p>Ideally, this is one of the those experiences you may get in your internships and first few jobs. But what are the chances of you ending up in such a team? And even if you get one helpful mentor, that's just one. If you stay in Open Source communities, you are constantly learning from numerous of those, and not just in summer for a period of three months.</p>\n<p>Our ways of doing software are heavily biased on the first projects we get involved with. We copy over the ideas to the future, since we know they have worked well. Exposure to multiple Open Source projects break that bias, and exposes us to other newer ways of creating Software.</p>\n<p>I have seen many issues on GitHub describing a problem that seems extremely hard to solve. And when GitHub says, <em>this issue got closed by this specific Pull Request</em> - I feel spoiled that I get to see what that Pull Request did. To have public access to such knowledge is a gift to this community.</p>\n<p>Not everyone studies Computer Science in college. And even if they do, their Software Engineering courses are either missing or outdated to the current day and age. MIT launched a course called - <a href=\"https://missing.csail.mit.edu/\">\"The Missing Semester of Your CS Education\"</a> to address this problem. Computer Science and Software Engineering have grown so much now, that it's impossible to teach both of them in a single curriculum. And the subjects have diverged - It has become Theory vs Practicality, Research vs Industry. Not all but most CS Professors are much closer to the research than the industry, and they expect students to do Open Source projects and internships on their own to gain the industry experience.</p>\n<p>Last but not least, a vast majority of Open Source work is done remote, over the internet, with strangers. The skills required to carry on a remote work become fundamental necessities - good written communication is one of many.</p>\n<h2>You escape the privilege barrier</h2>\n<p>In India, more than a million students graduate engineering courses <em>every year</em>. Every other job extended in my college placement season was somehow related to programming. This number gets higher with the several tiers of colleges. I imagine an average good Software Company would get a headcount of 10 new-grad engineers, to hire from the world.</p>\n<p>These numbers break my heart. Not everyone gets the chance to experience joy and growth in their career.</p>\n<p>Open Source is small but a beam of hope for these students. Google Summer of Code doesn't look at your IIT JEE rank for you to participate in it. Maintainers don't look at what Department or college you study in, before answering your questions. All these nonsensical privilege barriers do not exist in your way to improve yourself and learn.</p>\n<h2>You become a volunteer</h2>\n<p>Open Source contribution was my first exposure of volunteering and belongingness to a community. Not everything needs to be paid in money. I started seeing the return value in terms of learning, joy of accomplishing something, or just doing something together with people.</p>\n<p>I was part of a college group which helps college students learn more about Open Source. Looking back, I see that a lot of Open Source contributors follow the idea that - <em>Knowledge should be shared</em>. They start helping out people for no apparent reasons. Well mainly because someone else helped them in their journey and they want to continue the tradition.</p>\n<p>This feeling of volunteering (somewhat altruism) in Open Source still impresses me and others. The idea of non-monetary benefits in work is strange to a majority of people I have met professionally.</p>\n<h2>Toxic competitions are not for everyone</h2>\n<p>You might already know that college admission exams are highly competitive. One wants to get into the best college. One wants to study in the best department. One wants to score the highest grades. One wants to get Gold medals in the online competitive events.</p>\n<p>It easily gets toxic for some people. It changes the perception of their social life. Even when talking to friends, they think of things they know more of - due to their performances in previous competitions.</p>\n<p>I haven't seen that much competition when it comes to Open Source contributions. People help each other a lot more than trying to get ahead in some kind of race.</p>\n<h2>You might fall in love with Software</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman\">Richard Feynman</a> has said - <em>\"If you find science boring, you're learning it from a wrong teacher.\"</em></p>\n<p>I feel the same for programming. Students may not like the complexity of a doubly linked list written in C, but might enjoy Python's 10 lines of code for their web server. Sure a lot of people like writing Software, but not everyone <em>\"loves\"</em> to do it for their career.</p>\n<p>In contrast of only working with a handful of internship projects, working on many well designed Open Source software increase our chances of falling in love with it. And it helps.</p>\n<p><em>Thank you for reading! &#x3C;3</em></p>","timeToRead":4}},{"node":{"id":"88c5d1b3-a3d8-5504-a553-59be1222a6e3","frontmatter":{"categories":["Tech","Non-Tech"],"date":"Jun 2020","draft":false,"slug":"/blog/live-asynchronously","subtitle":"Bringing the philosophy of asynchronous programming into life.","summary":"Bringing the philosophy of asynchronous programming into life.","title":"Live Asynchronously"},"html":"<p>I first heard the phrase \"Live Asynchronously\" in <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/live-asynchronously-c8e7172fe7ea/\">this article</a> written by the amazing Quincy Larson, the creator of freecodecamp.org.</p>\n<p>In my last blog post about <a href=\"/blog/spotify/\">Joining Spotify in Sweden</a>, I wrote a bit about this. Here, I have written more about what living asynchronously means to me. I have put some concrete examples from life where I have used this philosophy.</p>\n<h2>Define Asynchronous</h2>\n<p>I have understood Asynchronous in programming but <a href=\"%5Bhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchrony%5D(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchrony)\">Asynchrony</a> has more (similiar) meanings.</p>\n<p>In my earliest days with Javascript, I remember being stuck one time. In my program I was doing an API request. Irrespective of whether the request was successful, my variable to store the API response was always <code class=\"language-text\">undefined</code>. I was in my first year of college and I expressed my frustration to my brother with <em>\"Javascript sucks\"</em>. All he said was <em>\"Remember, Javascript is asynchronous.\"</em> And that fixed the issue! I still see such problems and they get fixed by the <em>Remember...</em></p>\n<p>Most of the beginners face this problem with Javascript in their early days because Javascript is async in nature. This is unlike Python, which is a imperative (procedural) language.</p>\n<h3>Difference</h3>\n<p>Let us take this short example of a program to understand the difference.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">\n1. Say \"Hello World\".\n2. *API request to fetch an image from the internet.\n3. Based on the response of the request, store the image.\n4. Calculate 1 + 1.\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>In a procedural language like Python or C/C++, all the 4 lines will be executed one after the other. The lines 3 and 4 will be executed only when line 2 has completely finished (network request has completed). But, it could take a second or more to complete that request.</p>\n<p>Our program will spend most of its time at line 2 waiting for the network request to finish.</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>But, in an asynchronous language like Javascript, we will write the program differently.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">\n1. Say \"Hello World\".\n2. *API request to fetch an image from the internet.\n3.              (Callback) Based on the response of the network request, store the image.\n4. Calculate 1 + 1.\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Here, line 1 will be executed as usual. In line 2, we will do the API request. But, this time we are not going to wait around for the response. We will immediately move on to Line 4 and execute it. When the network call in line 2 finishes, we will execute the \"callback\" assigned to it in line 3.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p><strong>Asynchronous programming comes into the picture for the blocks of code which take significant time to execute i.e. something which blocks the procedural execution of the main program.</strong></p>\n<p>Sending an internet request, reading/writing to a file or a database takes way more time than calculating 1 + 1. So, we write a \"callback function\" for our asynchronous block of code. The callback decides what to do when the network request or the I/O operation completes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise\">Promise in Javascript</a> has the same philosophy and is more powerful than callbacks.</p>\n<h2>The Philosophy</h2>\n<p>Humans and computers function in an extraordinarily similar fashion. The I/O (Input/Output) operation for a computer is to talk to other computers. The I/O operation for us is to talk to other people.</p>\n<p>This blocks the main program. It means there is a chunk of time that it takes away from the main program for as long as the blocking execution is being done.</p>\n<p>These I/O operations are necessary for us to survive and communicate. They happen frequently and are also time-consuming. It then becomes important for us to manage them well.</p>\n<p><strong>Living Asynchronously is us making sure our I/O operations are asynchronous most of the time.</strong></p>\n<h2>Applying the philosophy</h2>\n<h3>Year 2004 Age 7</h3>\n<p>I remember in my school, our Maths textbooks used to have many questions in the form of exercises. An exercise was a collection of questions on one topic. There used to be dozens of chapters and hundreds of exercises in a book. The year-long school curriculum and timeline were to make sure all the chapters and their exercises get completed by the students.</p>\n<p>Generally, the entire batch of students is synchronised on what exercise they are doing. Let's say the teacher decides that this week, we are going to complete the Exercise 21 based on the basic Trigonometric formulae. By Monday next week, It is expected of the students to have their notebooks up-to-date. That's how synchronous programming works.</p>\n<p>This model is not great. Not everyone in the class needs to follow the pace set by the teacher for what they deem is suitable for the class.</p>\n<p>When I was in the 3rd standard (age 7), my father started teaching Maths to my elder brother and me. (Fun fact: All three of us now do programming for a living!). It was 2004. In the summer before the school would begin, dad had set the target for me to solve all the problems in the book I was going to study that year. I loved the experience! Although it took a lot of time from my summer vacation, it was rewarding. And I didn't want to stop there. Dad noticed this and bought me the maths textbooks for the following years. And this went on until in the 7th standard, I was doing the problems of the Maths book used in the 10th class.</p>\n<p>If I had followed the synchronous philosophy of the school, I would have to sit around throughout the year, learning not much new. A decade after that time, I would consciously start living asynchronously.</p>\n<h3>Working in college societies</h3>\n<p>Back in college, for five years I was part of a <a href=\"https://wiki.metakgp.org/w/Technology_Literary_Society\">literary society</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kossiitkgp\">a club</a> to promote open source. These were two separate groups and I was an active member of both! In my 3rd/4th year, I was part of the so called \"executive batch\". We were 4-5 people responsible to execute the events organized by 30-50 of us members, for the hundreds of students on campus to attend.</p>\n<p>Before we organized any event (a poetry night, an open mic, a Python or a GSoC workshop, etc.), I as the organizer needed to sync with all the members helping out. There are many operations that need to be taken care of, like logistics, publicity, poster distribution, members' performances/talks, communication with external members, finances, etc. If I remember correctly, I had burnt out early in the year. I had to sync with so many people during the days of the actual event. I valued the event's success not much by its attendance, but a lot by how we did it and the things we learned in the process.</p>\n<p>Lets take the task of poster distribution. The job was to print a bunch of posters for the event that had its details, description, contact, venue, time, etc. and paste it across the college campus so that other students would notice. From the team, I would assign one person to take care of this. This meant that they were responsible for going to the printing press, getting the copies done, and then with the help of other members, putting them up across the campus. Given I had other equally important tasks to take care of, it was a nightmare to contact all the people involved in this particular task. But, I couldn't just \"assign and forget\" the task to someone because, if he or she decided to slack off, it would disrupt the event. This has happened quite many times as I remember. So, I started identifying people I could trust, who shared the passion of the work and cared. And then, living asynchronously was easy and the only sane way to go about it.</p>\n<p><em>Then on, all my instructions and tasks had their <em>callbacks</em>. And if someone else asked me to do something, I would ask them to write their <em>callback</em> i.e. tell me what to do when I'm done with this. I reduced many unnecessary \"blocking\" I/O operations from my life, resulting in a much relaxed life.</em></p>\n<h3>WhatsApp message \"seen\" tick</h3>\n<p>Many years ago Facebook started showing things like \"message seen at 10:10 AM\" in their chatbox. This was the first time I saw something like this. Earlier, messaging someone was much like sending a very short email - you didn't expect a response within a minute. Instant communication started catching up and now there is a product called \"mail tracker\" which tells you when and how many times your email was read.</p>\n<p>I have disabled the blue seen tick in WhatsApp and I have a <a href=\"/blog/delete-facebook/\">dummy facebook account</a>. This means, I don't get to know when my message was read and the other person doesn't know when I read their message. This is me, trying to reduce \"synchronous\" communication from life, as it introduces more problems than it solves.</p>\n<p>If someone <em>sees</em> my message, I never ought to expect an instant response. I have no idea what they are doing in their \"main program\". They could be in a thought process, talking with someone else, working on something, or be in one of a thousand different possibilities. So \"seen at 10:10 AM\" gives me no information. It instead triggers me to think - <em>why have they not replied yet</em>.</p>\n<p>If I want to have a synchronous conversation, I would set up a call at the convenience of both of us. That is much efficient in every aspect. By not having to worry about replying instantly and not expecting someone to do so, I have freed a lot of time that I used to waste in waiting for the response.</p>\n<h3>Relationships and Behaviour</h3>\n<p>If I have the freedom of my thoughts, asynchrony is associated with freedom.</p>\n<p>If our actions and words demand synchronous response from the other person, it directly impacts their time. It affects how they want to spend it. Doing it way often is not nice. And it is a kind gesture to respect their time and do less synchronous communication. Allowing someone to be free is a great expression of love and it makes us better humans.</p>\n<p>I would be crazy to say that all synchronous communications are bad. That would be insane. What I do is reduce the frequency, and increase the time to generate more value. And of course, do lots of async stuff. :)</p>\n<h3>Blog post vs Notifications</h3>\n<p>A blog post is a shining example of communicating asynchronously in this world.</p>\n<p>This blog post does not demand anything from you. You can close it as soon as you opened it, read it now, a week later or next year. I have no expectation of knowing whether you read it or not, unless you want to let me know. I enjoy writing and reading them. They do not feel \"instant\". They do not say \"just now\" or \"posted a minute ago\". As Quincy Larson says - all notifications are synchronous. Social media wants to notify me if someone has said something publicly. Facebook/Instagram/Twitter wants to keep me in \"sync\" with what all my friends are doing. However, this blog post will sit here on this website. And if someone wants to see if I have written something new, it will be discovered.</p>\n<p>Ironically, I <em>am</em> going to tweet a link to this blog post. That will be synchronous. Oh, the hippocracy! ;)</p>\n<h3>Remote work promotes living asynchronously</h3>\n<p>Before my first job started, I was convinced that by introducing more asynchrony in life, I am saving my time and energy and I am being happier. When I started working, I had the challenge of adopting the same philosophy at work. I knew it would be challenging because people have their own style of working. But I tried my best to keep this philosophy alive with me.</p>\n<p>If I would have technical queries to ask, most of them would be Email or Slack and few in-person. As I understood the team and the technologies better over time, I would change all my questions to being asynchronous. That kept everyone involved a bit happier. The person who'd write the answer, would do so in their free time. Hence the responses had more details and helped me more than what a disrupting synchronous question would have done.</p>\n<p>When a project is newborn, synchronous communication between the stakeholders and engineers is necessary and valuable. They help avoid confusion and misunderstandings. But as the tasks start being granular, sync-meetings begin losing their value.</p>\n<p>If a project has grown large and has no documentation, there is no way asynchronous communication is possible even after months or years. The few people who created it, are going to waste more time answering questions, which they should have written in the form of documentation ages ago.</p>\n<p>Generally, product managers love to talk about projects in team meetings. Why won't they? They have a vision and want to share. But a wise engineering manager would come and ask, \"Can this information be shared via an email?\". This is a smart question to ask each time because it not only promotes written documentation but saves time for the involved engineers. They got time to focus and pay more attention to the work, which would have been disrupted by a synchronous meeting.</p>\n<p>Similar to blog posts, Documentation of projects and code is a light beam of hope in the asynchronous life. If I can find the documentation to read, it drastically reduces the amount of synchronous communication involved to solve my problem. And since a tap on the shoulder in not possible when working remotely, more written communication is the way to go!</p>\n<h3>TLDR (Too long, didn't read)</h3>\n<p>Living Asynchronously is inspired by the concept of asynchronous programming and Javascript's callbacks and promises. Synchronous life events are blocking in nature, are inefficient and time-consuming. It is not always possible, but living asynchronous life has its benefits and is a great way to live.</p>\n<p>I believe this philosophy is easy to understand and can be applied on many aspects of life. I encourage you to think on your own and identify the synchronous events in life. And then imagine how living asynchronously would feel.</p>","timeToRead":10}},{"node":{"id":"2f4bda2a-00d3-5618-927c-6ebdc382eb8b","frontmatter":{"categories":["letters"],"date":"Jun 2020","draft":false,"slug":"/letters/letter-with-no-subject-1","subtitle":"","summary":"","title":"Letter with no subject"},"html":"<h2>:name-retracted: wrote -</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hi Himanshu,</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Congratulations from the bottom of my heart for joining Spotify. We really miss you at college. You're one of the few seniors at KGP from whom I got really influenced in making changes in my life. I've been thinking of writing a letter to you since a few months as a chat/talk cannot convey the message with proper bandwidth. I wanted to talk about a lot of things. There isn't a purpose per se. If there's one thing I regret now that would be making myself away from you guys during my first year because of the intoxicated activities xD. I used to judge people blindly on the basis of their habits and think my parents are always right. As I grow up, I realise that not a single one has any idea of what they're doing in their life, how things progress and end. Everyone learns from their experiences and they think if they could change a decision that they took in the past, they could've avoided some problems in the present but that would erase a lot of things they've gained from their problems. This statement came from a show that I've watched recently called Dark by Netflix. I've been reading a lot of psychology recently and I realised that everyone who I thought was doing good has a lot of insecurities and they keep doing things having faith in their values, finding happiness in their small wins after the hardships and it's beautiful.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I'm getting confused a lot recently. I watched a show called Bojack Horseman and it was so depressing. Whenever I watch a single episode, I used to relate myself to the character who is a horse which always says things about life in a doomer way. I decided to read whenever I'm confused and not feel bad about feeling bad about myself. Whenever I feel like reading something, I either take my kindle or read an article from the internet. I've read your blog posts and letters multiple times and each time I read, I get a new insight. Thanks for writing those. I'm always intrigued by the way you write things in your blog. I hope that's how you think. It's really minimal and the flow of thoughts is incredibly linear. I read a book called Think Straight by Darius Foroux last year and it feels simple to do that, but not easy. I was curious to know how I think and how contaminated my thoughts are. I recently did a dopamine detox. It's more than a digital detox. I stayed away from my laptop, phone, television, kindle, instant gratification activities, talking with people, tea/coffee, etc. for 24 hours. Things I did were meditating and documenting my thoughts. Documentation of thoughts to clear the mind and to learn how you think is called brain vomit. I read about this somewhere from the internet. I always used to reset myself once in a week by smoking up and it does just the opposite of dopamine detox. But this thing was hard. I ended up meditating thrice. I didn't use an app or a specific technique per se. I was just accepting my thoughts by closing my eyes. So 3x1hr sessions. From the very next day, I felt fresh and relieved. I could do anything I was struggling with before. That frustration whenever I stuck while coding up a problem, the difficulties I faced while reading research papers which made me think about my lack of understanding capacity and whatnot - every distraction was just gone. I did my workout for 1hr followed by the remote work I've been trying to do and read my kindle in between. That day was beautiful. It went exactly as I planned but when I tried to sleep at night, I just couldn't sleep. The next day I wasn't insisting to do anything per se. Just did the things I felt like doing but I turned off the push notifications on my phone and used the internet when it was necessary only. I could sleep at that night very well. I felt interesting to experiment the things out of the books I read about habits. This doesn't seem to be the one suitable for me. I should adapt slowly by accepting my imperfections I feel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I'm closing this letter with this last paragraph. This is about things just getting right and suddenly everything goes wrong but still managing to breathe. When I visited New York for a code sprint last year, I was mind blown by the things I saw there. I wanted to visit the US again. I'd dreamed of settling there. So, I started working hard with the research and it took more than two months to get two of the FTs accepted with funding. There are long stories behind that. But that would make this letter even longer. So, I'm omitting those. I'd to setup my BTP also and I wanted to do that in CS dept. I sent mails to some profs, some didn't reply, some replied negatively and one replied positively asking me to meet him in the office. I'd hopes on him but he humiliated me instead there. I was like I am not good enough, I should be doing most of the people are doing and couldn't aim big. On the last date of application submission, I mailed a prof who didn't even reply once before and was not found in his office whenever I tried to meet him. I mailed him just for the sake of it as my facad told me that he would extend the deadline if I forward him a mail to a prof asking for BTP. Unexpectedly, he agreed to mentor me. Suddenly everything felt like were going exactly as I planned. The very next day US declared emergency because of covid and I just can't go there for my summers. They agreed to mentor me remotely though. I reached home just before the lockdown and it's been two months now. My parents are really happy to have me around. They're afraid of me getting away from them. It's really hard to work from home. This covid made me afraid to settle abroad and still got me confused. This letter turned out to be really long and contain a lot of personal information. I didn't do that on purpose.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Regards,</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<h2>I responded -</h2>\n<p>Hi :name-retracted:,</p>\n<p>Thank you for writing this letter. Also, thank you for opening up and sharing the thoughts from your mind. This is a rare pleasure. Let me try to reciprocate! :)</p>\n<p>I first saw you on a Metakgp demo day event and I have been fascinated by you since then. Those were the early years of KOSS. I was looking for people in KGP who resonated with the idea. I would always carry a mental model of students with me who were perfect for a community like KOSS and people who would definitely enjoy being there. What you were in your first year, soon became the face of my mental model.</p>\n<p>With your experience, intellect and ability to communicate, you are easily someone I wanted to be in my first year. I am glad our efforts and the people involved in the KGP Open Source community fascinated you and now we are close.</p>\n<p>What you wrote above related to intoxication made me so excited! They have been some of my favourite topics to talk about. Externally it looks like a conversation about having a drink early in college, but the bigger picture is more about waking up.</p>\n<p>I believe most of us in our first year are not awake in many senses. Just after the restless two years of the grand exam preparation, we are not ready to own our thoughts and actions. We eagerly seek advice, for someone to answer us -- What now?. We are sensitive and vulnerable to our surroundings. Some of us use the words of our parents and guardians as the governing principles of our life. Some of us blindly follow the first few seniors that we meet and spend our whole college life doing things which we wouldn't have done otherwise. This is harmful in many ways but not necessarily bad for everyone.</p>\n<p>Talking about life in college, I am currently reading <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11084145-steve-jobs\">Steve Jobs biography by Walter Isaacson</a>. The pages about his college life are inspiring to me. I would not do everything that he used to do (Extreme diets, sleeplessness, not showering, being rude to parents/people in general), but his energy and attitude towards life defined him in those moments.</p>\n<p>The young students of IITs refusing to do some things which the society has asked them not to do, is a grey area to talk about. Without forcing anything on them, I would instead share one of these questions that I asked myself very early in college.</p>\n<p><em>Am I thinking for myself?</em></p>\n<p><em>Do I question everything?</em></p>\n<p><em>How important is it for me to solve this assignment?</em></p>\n<p><em>What difference will it make if I get a B instead of A or EX grade?</em></p>\n<p><em>Is this the best use of my time?</em></p>\n<p><em>Do I have the right people around me?</em></p>\n<p><em>Are my friendships healthy? Am I exploring the depths of my relationships?</em></p>\n<p><em>Do I love the work that I do or want to do in future?</em></p>\n<p>Good news is that a lot of us start thinking for ourselves sooner or later. But to do it as early as possible is an amazing experience and shows us the parts of life which we couldn't have seen otherwise. To sum it up, I am not directly promoting drinking and smoking up in college. Doing it mindlessly has bad consequences for most of us. They are nothing but a medium for us to start living a free life in a higher state of consciousness. What you have written above about the realisation and acceptance makes you brave, and you should see it this way.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your words about my blog. I am influenced by <a href=\"http://paulgraham.com/talk.html\">Paul Graham's Write Like You Talk essay</a>. I was in the literary society back in college and I would see writers complicate their pieces by trying to write in a very different, unreal way, which they thought is aesthetic. At the same time, I was fascinated by the poems and proses which were easy to comprehend but much harder to fully understand. Talking about Paul Graham, my favourite essay from him is called <a href=\"http://paulgraham.com/vb.html\">Life is Short</a>. I keep getting back to this essay every couple months. It is heartfelt advice for people of our age.</p>\n<p>Lovely to hear about your full day dopamine detox. Damn, I could never do it now. If my mother tried calling me on Whatsapp and I wouldn't respond in an hour or two, she will start getting worried. But, I respect the idea. I am also fascinated by the 10 days Vipassana meditation course where we eat less, live in silence and do Vipassana meditation 10 hours per day, to witness thoughts and sensations come and go.</p>\n<p>I remember that you quit Facebook too. It is amazing how we want to spend a healthy life by being mindful about all the dopamine agents around us. I think one of the worst habits of people (including me) is that we do not respect the time between waking up in the morning and us connecting and catching up with the internet. That period of time determines how the rest of our day will go. Some people call it having a slow morning, which is doing slow, mundane things in that block of time. It includes things like making coffee, making our bed, washing dishes, showering, staring outside at the morning sun, etc. This slowness boosts our energy for the rest of the day. For me, nothing is worse than getting up from bed and scrolling Twitter for 10 minutes straight. That dials down my tempo for hours in the day. You can read more about \"Slow Morning\" on the internet.</p>\n<p>I am personally sad to see the effects of COVID-19 on the college students. I feel sad that you didn't get to experience the internship in the US. But I'm happy to know that you got to work remotely!</p>\n<p>Your story with the professors back in KGP is disappointing. For me, it has been a vicious circle of me skipping classes and me not learning anything from my professors. The segregation of departments and disciplines is a legacy model and affects many students who want to study subjects outside of our assigned departments.</p>\n<p>Let me end by mentioning a letter from Richard Feynman called <a href=\"https://lettersofnote.com/2015/10/23/do-not-remain-nameless-to-yourself/\">Do not remain nameless to yourself</a>. He wrote this to one of his PhD students after winning the Nobel Prize. You might have read this already. It is inspiring for people in Science and Technology. Barriers like nasty professors or broken interview systems will not stop you and me from accomplishing what we want to do. \"No problem is too small or too trivial if we can really do something about it.\" Someone as skilful as you should grow thick skin for them and keep working on things that you love. I know you love solving problems and creating software. It should be all that is important.</p>\n<p>Definitely enjoy the time at home with family. Let's keep in touch.</p>","timeToRead":9}},{"node":{"id":"f9b08919-1926-5365-ba16-9756ddfdad25","frontmatter":{"categories":["Tech"],"date":"May 2020","draft":false,"slug":"/blog/spotify","subtitle":"Thoughts on Japan, my principles of work and what lies ahead.","summary":"I have written about living in Japan, my work principles and what lies ahead.","title":"Joining Spotify in Sweden"},"html":"<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 720px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 30%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAGCAYAAADDl76dAAAACXBIWXMAAC4jAAAuIwF4pT92AAAA0UlEQVQY033Qv0qCYRgF8F/SUFOjNPfnEgQHFwdrK3CKLiArhELBRYUIvAOhlpAgUCK6Abemlpps6BaaShCiofjwKRy+PNPDc95znvMepmjhA1+4wrJ0ZPyPP+4II/RxhzdcBldAMUW8gA3ksIu1WfIJXVRQwyme49EFjnEQ+0R8iAZuIswjTrCFfGL4giGaaGOAMVaxh3vchuFDHOhFiA7OQpdUtZgYVvGNd7ziE9eRvoQdnGMf2Tiyju2oZBN1lGe/3YjuJtHfUkpn87DyO/0A/AEoMwETdC4AAAAASUVORK5CYII='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n          <source\n              srcset=\"/static/c97391051b6b4cbe34d7a1bfe040d88d/7c297/spotify.webp 180w,\n/static/c97391051b6b4cbe34d7a1bfe040d88d/33ecc/spotify.webp 360w,\n/static/c97391051b6b4cbe34d7a1bfe040d88d/df77d/spotify.webp 720w,\n/static/c97391051b6b4cbe34d7a1bfe040d88d/5c666/spotify.webp 1080w,\n/static/c97391051b6b4cbe34d7a1bfe040d88d/95f20/spotify.webp 1440w,\n/static/c97391051b6b4cbe34d7a1bfe040d88d/5d4cc/spotify.webp 2362w\"\n              sizes=\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\"\n              type=\"image/webp\"\n            />\n          <source\n            srcset=\"/static/c97391051b6b4cbe34d7a1bfe040d88d/e9ea2/spotify.png 180w,\n/static/c97391051b6b4cbe34d7a1bfe040d88d/53918/spotify.png 360w,\n/static/c97391051b6b4cbe34d7a1bfe040d88d/242a6/spotify.png 720w,\n/static/c97391051b6b4cbe34d7a1bfe040d88d/b4ad3/spotify.png 1080w,\n/static/c97391051b6b4cbe34d7a1bfe040d88d/89066/spotify.png 1440w,\n/static/c97391051b6b4cbe34d7a1bfe040d88d/e1cb3/spotify.png 2362w\"\n            sizes=\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\"\n            type=\"image/png\"\n          />\n          <img\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n            src=\"/static/c97391051b6b4cbe34d7a1bfe040d88d/242a6/spotify.png\"\n            alt=\"spotify\"\n            title=\"spotify\"\n            loading=\"lazy\"\n            decoding=\"async\"\n            style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n          />\n        </picture>\n    </span>\n<a href=\"https://newsroom.spotify.com/media-kit/logo-and-brand-assets/\"><em>Image source</em></a></p>\n<h2>Life in Japan</h2>\n<p>All the things that I knew about Japan turned out to be true, as soon as I arrived here 8 months ago.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Japan is a <strong>beautiful</strong> place to live! The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry_blossom\">cherry blossoms</a> season just started. There is a lot of nature surrounding downtown Tokyo. I haven't experienced the peak of summer here yet, but the cold climate has been cherry on top of it all.</p>\n<p>I spent five years in my college campus where you could spot trees from anywhere (my hostel room, classrooms and the roads). Having all this nature around me once again was a relief.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Most <strong>people are mindful, quiet and private</strong>. This is great for those who want to live a private life. I believe my friends and I used to be the only ones talking in the entire freaking train.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Delicacies</strong>! I don't remember having a bad meal ever. The proportion size and the amount of calories are thoughtfully decided. The meals are prioritized to be healthy <em>and</em> tasty. This is not true for many countries.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Japan is very <strong>safe</strong>. I know many of my friends never locked their apartments before going out (bad idea). Walking outside late at nights does not feel threatening. I am raised to be careful about incoming traffic and being stoic about what could go wrong. Certainly, I have never had any bad experience. I didn't encounter any homeless people either.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The city is mostly clean. People do not enter anyone's house with their shoes on. There is almost zero vandalism.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <strong>customer service</strong> can not be imagined and replicated easily in other societies of the world. I know and have heard that people in India are very helpful. I felt people in Japan sometimes do <em>beyond normal</em> things for their customers. People take their jobs very seriously. The entire bank staff greets you when you come in. You will not be left unattended even for a minute. And everyone will say Thank you and keep bowing until you get out of the door and disappear. My God, I used to feel bad.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The not-so-good things that I had heard are also true!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Language barrier</p>\n<p>You can get by in Tokyo if you don't know Japanese and have friends whom you can talk to. But my life was of a <em>tourist</em> and was limited in social terms. Essential shopping (groceries, etc.) becomes limited. I have to show an image and hope that the person can recognize what I am asking for. Using a public service e.g. Hospitals, courier service is hard. I can not enquire what I want to. Google Translate is barely helpful, and is useless most of the times.</p>\n<p>Many people learn Japanese after coming here. They see a life here and want to settle. As of now, I know I only want to <em>settle</em> in India and maybe in an English speaking country. My work required no Japanese, hence I did not learn. Instead I invested my time in learning new paradigms of programming in a large company. I feel I made the right decision and learnt a lot.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Rush hour traffic</p>\n<p>You need courage to commute in the morning. Even if I wanted to start my day early, it is not going to happen. Trains are packed at more than 200% of their capacity between 7-9 AM. I won't need to hold any bars in the moving trains because maybe five people would be pushing me from all directions. Lo and behold the laws of physics, I won't fall or even move when the train accelerated. xD</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Principles of work</h2>\n<p><em>Things I learnt in my first job</em></p>\n<h3>Living asynchronously</h3>\n<p>Three years ago, I read this blog post by Quincy Larson, the founder of freecodecamp.org, titled <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/live-asynchronously-c8e7172fe7ea/\">Live asynchronously.</a>. I got inspired by it. I took the concepts of Promises and callbacks in Javascript on a philosophical level.</p>\n<p>Working Synchronously is the easy option. Async is hard to code and to practice in real life.</p>\n<p>Living async means writing negligible number of messages/emails which require you to constantly wait until there is response. They block you from continuing to work on something else. Living async means lesser number of unimportant meetings and sync ups. In fact, when I used to be stuck in the beginning, I used to write my doubts as long expressive messages and would not expect a response immediately. I think I learnt this from the Open Source communities. ;)</p>\n<p><em>Edit: Some folks asked me on twitter to elaborate on this, so I wrote a follow up blog post about <a href=\"https://orkohunter.net/blog/live-asynchronously/\">living asynchronously</a>.</em></p>\n<h3>Working concurrently</h3>\n<p>I always took two or more concurrent (independent) tasks at the same time. If I get blocked or maybe bored with the first task, I would switch to the second one and would wait until I get unblocked. It is not feasible when the first task is huge. But even then, it can be broken down into chunks of concurrent pieces. And then, I would \"parallelly process\" them on my end.</p>\n<h3>Writing daily notes</h3>\n<p>I used to take notes aggressively when I started working. I would write more than 100 words each day. I would publish them on an internal Confluence space.</p>\n<p>The main reasons for doing this were -</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>We forget</strong>. The meetings with our managers, mentors and coworkers in our first month are crucial. They convey some of the most important things about the company, team, project, etc. It was important for me to write <em>all</em> of it down.</li>\n<li><strong>Self review</strong>. At the end of the day, I would go through my notes and publish a summary of things I did, things I learnt, etc. It would take 10 minutes each day. My quarterly self reviews used to be very very long and exhaustive, since I had the logs of what I did. After six months, I changed the frequency of publishing the logs to weekly, but I would still take daily private notes.</li>\n<li><strong>Being public</strong>. My page was easily accessible by visiting <code class=\"language-text\">go/himanshu</code> from inside the company. I loved that I was being transparent about how I am spending my time in the company. And it also helped my indirect co-workers to know what I do here.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Docs, docs. code. docs. docs. Technical specs.</h3>\n<p>Working on code without documentation is not fun. You are surprised each time you add a new feature. You have low confidence when making changes. For the love of humanity, document your decisions and the architecture.</p>\n<h3>Integration tests</h3>\n<p>Unit tests are great. But I love end to end integration tests a lot. They give me more confidence that the functionality will not break with my PRs being merged. I couldn't resist writing an integration test for the project I was working on. <a href=\"https://natooktesting.wordpress.com/2017/08/24/x-unit-tests-0-integration-tests/\">You might have seen some gifs about X unit tests and 0 integration tests.</a></p>\n<h3>No unconstructive criticism</h3>\n<p>When we join a new place, we notice hundreds of things that can be done better (according to us). If I go on complaining about all, and do not offer to fix any, I am being unhelpful. So, I did not offer any unnecessary feedback or criticism unless they were constructive.\nThis is the Chapter 1 of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Win_Friends_and_Influence_People\">How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie</a>.</p>\n<h3>Scoping a project, breaking down into smaller tasks</h3>\n<p>A good engineer is supposed to see the bigger picture of a project. They collaborate hand in hand with Product managers and help in writing the Spec. They break the project into smaller tasks which help them correctly estimate the timeline. They offer creative solutions which the PM might not be aware of.\nThis skill comes with experience and time spent in the company and is valued by everyone around.</p>\n<h2>Next steps with Spotify</h2>\n<p>In a few months, I will relocate to Stockholm, Sweden. Hopefully, the travel is permitted by then. My work will be related to Spotify's newly open sourced project called <a href=\"https://github.com/spotify/backstage\">Backstage</a>. Spotify has been developing this for four years and has now decided to open source it, to simplify the infrastructure complexity in companies. Check it out, you'll find it interesting. <a href=\"https://backstage.io/\">backstage.io</a></p>\n<p>I am personally very excited that I will get to work closely with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/decause/\">Remy Decausemaker</a> again. Remy was my direct manager at Twitter. He now leads the Open Source program at Spotify. I have learnt so much about Open Source in the time that I have worked with him and I feel blessed that there lies more. :)</p>\n<p>As far as I know from Spotify engineering blogs and the people, it has a strong engineering culture. Teams (Squads) have autonomy of the work they do. People share knowledge and support collaboration and individual growth. I intend to stay in the company for long and hopefully I come out as a much better engineer.</p>\n<p>Plus, Spotify is a product that I have been using for many years. It has helped me find artists who have touched my soul. I am very excited about what lies ahead.</p>\n<p>Cheers!</p>","timeToRead":7}},{"node":{"id":"61070536-f22e-56f1-a2c8-2f07184c95c8","frontmatter":{"categories":["Tech","Non-Tech"],"date":"Feb 2020","draft":false,"slug":"/blog/bfs-vs-dfs-in-friendships","subtitle":"In real life friendships, some prefer Breadth First Search, but some fancy Depth First Search","summary":"In real life friendships, some prefer Breadth First Search, but some fancy Depth First Search. BFS and DFS are two search methods in Computer Science.","title":"BFS vs DFS in friendships"},"html":"<p>If you already know and remember what <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search\">Breadth First Search (BFS)</a> and\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search\">Depth First Search (DFS)</a> are, skip to <strong>What are you saying?</strong></p>\n<p>Take my words with a grain of salt. I am mostly writing metaphors here.</p>\n<h2>Quick intro to BFS and DFS</h2>\n<p>In Graph Theory, we perform a search by traversing the graph. We start with one node and traverse the entire graph until we find what we are looking for.</p>\n<p>There are many ways to do that, but the two most popular ones are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search\">Breadth First Search (BFS)</a>\nand <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search\">Depth First Search (DFS)</a>. The name of the method is key to what do they do.</p>\n<p>In BFS, we search all the neighbour nodes first. And then search the 2nd-degree neighbours, then 3rd-degree, and so on. Here is a neat animation from Wikipedia for you.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/Animated_BFS.gif\" alt=\"BFS GIF\"></p>\n<p>But in DFS, we start with a neighbour and keep going in its branch as deep as we can, and then backtrack to a second neighbour and go deep into its branch, and so on.</p>\n<p>Read the wikipedia articles if you want to know more. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search\">BFS</a> &#x26; <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search\">DFS</a>.</p>\n<h2>What are you saying?</h2>\n<p>BFS and DFS can be seen among people as traits of how they make friends. Like introversion and extroversion, BFS and DFS are the characteristics of people's approach to <em>friendship</em>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>You might already have some idea by now. Take few seconds and draw a picture. Imagine two people (one doing BFS and other doing DFS)\nand think how they are different. It is fun to observe and ponder. :)</em></p>\n<p>College campus life is a perfect setting to spot both kinds of people.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>How are they different?</h2>\n<p>A person who is on the extreme end with <strong>BFS</strong> would generally have a larger number of friends and smaller number of acquaintances.\nThey constantly seek to convert their acquaintances into friends. They do not have any hard time making friends with someone.\nThey have a fear of missing out on creating new friendships as time slips by.</p>\n<p>A person who is on the other extreme with <strong>DFS</strong> would have a significant number of acquaintances but a smaller number of friends.\nThey would always be interested in taking their friendships on to the next level. They are NOT afraid of missing out on new friendships\nand want to work a lot on the existing ones.</p>\n<p><strong>BFS</strong> people can generate the same intensity in new friendships, as with their existing friends. They don't need much time for this.\nYet, most of the time BFS people are afraid to go deep into conversations with one friend. They would stop at one point.\nThey would fall out of conversations pretty easily. They wouldn't be interested in knowing more about their friends.\nThey would be certain they know enough about them.</p>\n<p><strong>DFS</strong> people never get bored with the friends they hangout with. They are willing to share deepest level of spiritual secrets\nwith each other. It takes a significant amount of time for their newer friendships to reach the intensity of their existing\nfriendships. They have strong perceptions, but loosely-held. They would cheer to look at things from other people's perceptions.</p>\n<p><em>Let me know if you can think of more differences.</em></p>\n<h2>Final words</h2>\n<p>Everyone has to do BFS first. In first year of college, you don't have enough nodes to do DFS with. So, you spend the first\n(and maybe second) year doing BFS. You join clubs, you hangout with your hostel-mates, and neighbours to create\n<a href=\"/blog/threads/\">threads</a>.</p>\n<p>After this, if you are a DFS person, your DFS mode will trigger. And it never stops.</p>\n<p>I do not have a dichotomous view on which is the right way of living. I believe one has to find the right balance.</p>\n<p><em>Thanks to <a href=\"https://nishnik.me\">Nishant Nikhil</a> for bringing this up, one fine evening back in college.</em></p>","timeToRead":3}}],"totalCount":6}},"pageContext":{}},
