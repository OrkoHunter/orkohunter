And like many, my first year was pretty bad in terms of both social and academic growth. I made very little effort to make new friends, skipped most classes, scored 7 point something CGPA and had no idea what I was going to do in life.</p>\n<p>Although I had prior understanding of programming, my first hands-on keyboard experience was my Data Structures and Algorithms course. Those juicy Sun Microsystems computers and fully air conditioned labs used to put me to sleep after lunch. I was a slow learner in that class. I was started struggling a lot when the time came to implement linked lists or perform string manipulations in character arrays. Segmentation Fault used to be the highlight of most days.</p>\n<p>Somehow, I managed to pass all the exams and started doing all the random things college freshers do in India - soldering thin wires on an iron plate, mistaking flasks for bowls in chemistry labs while wearing thick white coats and shovelling soil. We all have done it all.</p>\n<p>Second semester started and something was missing. Not that long ago, I had cracked IIT JEE, what is supposed to be country's most difficult engineering exam which everyone writes. Millions. And I was top 2000 in the country. Not too bad, eh? And here I was, clueless about life. And it was not just me, others were clueless just like me.</p>\n<p>This is when my <em>bhaiya</em> told me about Open Source and Google Summer of Code. <em>\"Create a GitHub profile and start contributing to previous GSoC projects\"</em> he said. The horrors of implementing a linked list in C were fresh in my mind. I started learning Python. I remember a phone call when I said - <em>\"it just feels like a wrapper which is easy to understand, but isn't this just cheating? I don't understand C. I don't know programming\"</em>. I was doing everything possible to sabotage my self-esteem and tell myself that I'm a failure and can't write code.</p>\n<p>The night GSoC results came out, I changed. It felt like Open Source will resurrect my joy and meaning in life.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>What you have just read involves a lot of luck but also persistence. And still, only 0.01% make it this far with this speed. Think about all the students who didn't get proper coaching to study for IIT JEE. All the students in Tier 2, Tier 3 colleges who thought they can get good jobs just by attending classes and doing well in exams.</p>\n<p>Our country is training students to pass exams and not really to get real world experience or acquire knowledge. This is no surprise, we've known this for a while. However, now I feel nothing will change if we keep ranting and not do anything about it.</p>\n<p>While we're just thinking about all of this, there are \"influencers\" with millions of followers on YouTube and Instagram, telling batshit crazy things to students. With no professional experience, they are preparing an army of next generation of students in India - all driven by fear and fandom. This all came to light with the biggest fuck up in India's EdTech industry - Byju's, which made billions, cashing on the fear, doubt and uncertainty of Indian parents for their kids' education.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Over the course of five years in college, I spent countless hours trying to create more such stories like mine. In my first year, only 4 students were selected for GSoC. In my final year, the count was 32. Many went ahead to create their own projects that summer. In my first year, competitive coding and leetcode were the go-to ways to land a job. In my final year, there were companies taking direct interviews if you had done GSoC or had good Open Source projects in your resume.</p>\n<p>This all happened due to a handful of us trying to teach Open Source, Git, GitHub, Python and most importantly, created an inclusive environment for anyone to be a hacker and take control of their destiny. One of those groups is still active after 10 years of existence, it's called <a href=\"https://kossiitkgp.org/\">Kharagpur Open Source Society</a>.</p>\n<p>Our flagship program <a href=\"https://kwoc.kossiitkgp.org/\">Kharagpur Winter of Code</a> is one of the finest ways to get young IIT students get started with Open Source. In the first year, we had 2500+ registration and 100s created their first meaningful Pull Request ever. I know few of them personally, some are really smart engineers and builders today, while some are pursuing higher education at esteemed institutions in US and Europe. In the following years, many other IITs and colleges started their own \"Winter of Code\" programs. The spark had ignited a fire.</p>\n<p>In recent years, my work has taken me to different fields, with diverse people and cultures. These experiences have only deepened my pride in the unique and valuable communities I had experienced at IIT KGP and KOSS. Yet, I can‚Äôt ignore some challenges that persist even today. It's unsettling for me and I spend too much time thinking about it.</p>\n<p>There's so much to discuss and lots to learn. I realized there are many who feel this way and want a place to continue sharing their stories. The whole thing exploded with my latest blog post called <a href=\"/2f4908a49fe85424343cffb8461d601f/why-dont-you-move-abroad.md\">Why Don't You Move Abroad?</a>.</p>\n<p>I invite you all to join me in these conversations.

Strangely enough, the very first time I came to US, it was also as a speaker at a conference.</p>\n<p><em>‚ÄúDid you just say you are a speaker at this thing?‚Äù</em>, asked the US Visa officer, before stamping a B1/B2 on my Passport for ten years.</p>\n<p>I was 18 back then. The confusion made sense.</p>\n<p>A decade has gone by. I got married, switched multiple jobs, wrote a lot of code, lived in three different continents, spoke at many conferences and made a lot of friends for life. I am now back living in India.</p>\n<p><em>‚ÄúDude, so when are you moving to the US?‚Äù,</em> I frequently get asked by friends, colleagues and my well-wishers.</p>\n<p><em>‚ÄúI‚Äôm not‚Äù.</em></p>\n<p>My answer falls flat on most people. It‚Äôs as if, I‚Äôve just said, <em>‚ÄúI do not want more money and success.‚Äù</em></p>\n<p>In this blog post I want to add more colors to my answer. Hope some of you relate with this, especially if you are someone like me considering your decision of moving abroad or moving back.</p>\n<p>But first, let me take you back to my teens when life was much simpler and Physics was my most favorite thing in life.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-iit-dream\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-iit-dream\" aria-label=\"the iit dream permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The IIT Dream</h2>\n<p>Just like many Indians of my generation, I spent my childhood in a single bedroom rented house. Every evening, my brother and I would sit in front of a oil lamp (later battery lamp) and study maths and science. In the mornings, our <em>dada ji</em> would teach us English and Hindi grammar. It was a household where two things were most valued - Education and Love.</p>\n<p>Education, because that seemed like the only way to escape generational poverty and not having to worry about, if there are enough candlesticks to last the week or not.</p>\n<p>And, Love because <em>familia is everything</em>.</p>\n<p>Millions of students in India prepare to get into IITs every year. With the proper amount of luck and improper amount of childhood sacrifices, I made it into IIT Kharagpur. And that changed everything.</p>\n<p>During the admission to engineering colleges, more than two thirds of students want to study Computer Science. This is what increases the chances of landing a job and what everyone seems to be doing. In my hostel room in Kota where I studied for 2 years of IIT prep, I had a note stuck on my wall which listed all the opening and closing ranks of all Computer Science branches in the 7 major IITs. When I saw the results and my rank, it was nowhere close to those CS cutoff ranks and I teared up as if I had failed.</p>\n<p>And just like that, 99.99% of Indian students start their education journey by the system telling them that they are not worth it and they don‚Äôt even get to decide what they study.</p>\n<p>While I couldn‚Äôt get into the Computer Science department, I knew what I wanted to study. My father has been a software engineer since the 90s and my brother is an absolute rockstar with computers. We didn‚Äôt have cartoons in TV back in our childhood but had our hands on keyboard ever since I could possibly remember.</p>\n<p>So, I was ready to join IIT and say <em>‚ÄúFuck you,‚Äù</em> to the education system, ‚Äú<em>I‚Äôm going to be the best programmer the world has ever seen.‚Äù</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"college-and-open-source\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#college-and-open-source\" aria-label=\"college and open source permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>College and Open Source</h2>\n<p>I was nowhere close to being the best programmer. I failed to implement a linked list in C in my first year. It was not going well. However, at the same time, I created my first Python package <a href=\"https://github.com/morse-talk/morse-talk\">morse-talk</a> and published on pypi.org. It was immediately used by a professor somewhere in Europe who forked it and made a lot of contributions.</p>\n<p>My goal of being the ‚Äúbest programmer‚Äù shifted to \"create value for others by writing code\". That summer, only 4 students were selected in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code\">Google Summer of Code</a> from my college. I was one of them, the only freshman. Two years of GSoC paid more than enough to cover my five years of college tuition fees. I found both value and meaning by doing Open Source.</p>\n<p>Very quickly, people started referring me with my <a href=\"https://github.com/orkohunter\">GitHub handle</a> OrkoHunter. I, among few of my good friends, established <a href=\"https://kossiitkgp.org/\">Kharagpur Open Source Society</a> to spread the culture of Open Source in campus. Though secretly, it was to give hope to the students who were defeated by the education system and told <em>‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt study Computer Science, because you didn‚Äôt know Carbon has a radioactive isotope.‚Äù</em> In the first few years, we exclusively hired only non-CS students out of spite.</p>\n<h2 id=\"twitter--san-francisco\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#twitter--san-francisco\" aria-label=\"twitter  san francisco permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Twitter @ San Francisco</h2>\n<p>I was having a blast with the altruism that came with organizing Open Source workshops for students, helping them write their first useful Python application and making their first Pull Request. In 2017, we organized our first ever Open Source conference in college. We had about a thousand attendees, two days of talks, tutorials and lots of fun. We had full blown AV setup, speakers and attendees coming from multiple cities. We had a large budget too. I was leading it, being one of the three co-chairs of the conference. We were living the dream!</p>\n<p>One night during the summit, I received an email from a recruiter at Twitter - <em>‚ÄúHey Himanshu, We saw your GitHub profile. Would you like to join us for an internship at Twitter San Francisco office in the Open Source team?‚Äù</em>. I was so busy with the conference that I forgot to respond for 24 hours. She reached back - <em>‚ÄúHimanshu, are you interested?‚Äù</em></p>\n<p>Landing a foreign internship in college is one of those 0.1% things - it‚Äôs extremely rare. You need to practice a lot of leetcode, have excellent referrals and be a sports programmer ready to traverse a binary tree. I have never written a Binary Tree traversal in life.</p>\n<p>My interviews were all around the projects I had open sourced by then. One being the most popular Python library for Graph Theory, the other being a package used to study X-ray data from black holes. I was working on much more important things. Learning how to traverse a Binary Tree for me was a waste of time - that‚Äôs how I saw it back then. I knew I will most likely never use it. Though I used to be maniacal about writing reusable code and ReactJS!</p>\n<p>I applied for the J1 visa (short term work visa) and made my way to San Francisco. That summer in SF was probably the coldest summer I had ever. The internship paid extremely well and taught a lot of things about corporate Open Source. I worked upon setting up the <a href=\"https://opensource.twitter.dev\">opensource.twitter.dev</a> - something which still runs and publishes weekly reports of Twitter‚Äôs flagship open source projects. I‚Äôm pretty sure Elon Musk has seen the website.</p>\n<p>Career-wise, it was the best thing that could have happened to me. My manager from Twitter moved to Spotify later on who told me about the Backstage Open Source project, which led me to Harness leading the product built on top of Backstage. As Steve Jobs once said, <em>‚Äúyou will only be able to connect the dots looking backwards.‚Äù</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-emotional-turmoil-in-san-francisco\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-emotional-turmoil-in-san-francisco\" aria-label=\"the emotional turmoil in san francisco permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The Emotional Turmoil in San Francisco</h2>\n<p>Despite the thrilling career advancements that summer, I often wept myself to sleep at nights. The timezone difference between India and US west coast is about 12 hours. Which means, when you wake up, your family and friends are about to go to bed. And when you come back from office, your family has just woken up. Couple of hours is all you get to connect with anyone back home.</p>\n<p>Okay, here‚Äôs the thing, I had lived alone before. For the IIT prep, I was in Kota for 2 years locked in my room and studying, visited home only two times during Diwalis. My college was in a remote village and far from home as well. But I had never felt that lonely, being on the other side of the world than home.</p>\n<p>I am also not an introvert when it comes to talking to strangers. I was leading two student groups in college and fortunately made a lot of friends. It was easy for me to approach seniors, batch mates and juniors in college to build relationships. However, making friends in US was a completely different ballgame.</p>\n<p>Money and Status was on everyone‚Äôs mind. All they talked about was Visas, dating, getting paid more and playing a different kind of game that I wanted to play. Not many <em>truly</em> wanted to be a software engineer or cared about Software. While I found few who did and made a real attempt to know each other - the friendships I found in the US were very shallow. Back home, we called them acquaintances.</p>\n<p>It all felt ‚Ä¶ like an unlivable place for commoners like me. Homelessness was at its peak. I am the guy, who likes to walk slow on the streets without a destination. But I was told on day one Twitter orientation to <em>‚ÄúWalk fast‚Äù</em>. Drugged homeless people approached me, one guy tried to hit me while waiting to cross the street. I once went out to get some groceries and when making a turn, I saw a person holding a gun, hiding at the turn, waiting for someone. I had never seen a gun in my life till that point. It made me think - <em>‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm caught accidentally in a gun fight here, no amount of legal justice or candle marches would make my parents happy‚Äù.</em></p>\n<p>Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I have a huge respect for San Francisco and the Bay Area. For me, it still is one of the most beautiful places on earth. Being an engineer as well as follower of Ram Dass and Timothy Leary, I thank the west for what it has given to world. One of the first Open Source license BSD, came from Berkley. The computer I am using to write this on, came from the valley. Silicon Valley is an absolutely historic place for a techie like me. I actually felt quiet emotional walking on the Haight-Ashbury street. The words ‚ÄúTurn On, Tune In and Drop out‚Äù echoed in my ears.</p>\n<p>Despite the respect for the place and culture, I found myself struggling to become one with it. After spending 4 months there, I still had one year of college left. On my final day in US, I ate my last bagel sandwich in a cafe in Mission district and boarded my flight back to Kolkata. After 24 hours of flight and three hours of cab drive, I reached my hostel. One of my dear friends was waiting for me downstairs at 2AM. We hugged and I knew, I had arrived <em>home</em>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"college-placements-and-first-job\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#college-placements-and-first-job\" aria-label=\"college placements and first job permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>College placements and first job</h2>\n<p>Being an Indian student, it is almost impossible to get your first job in the US. Very rarely companies take the chance of picking you to go through H1B lottery, employers go for a safer choice. My manager at Twitter tried to get me a job, but after months of struggle, he gave up, and I had no job offer.</p>\n<p>All IITs and most colleges have a ‚Äúplacement season‚Äù where companies fly in on campus and hire as many students as they can within a short period of time. It‚Äôs a flea market. Thousands of students show up in collared white shirts, blue pants and polished black shoes with resumes in their hands. Day 1 placement makes you a rockstar among your friends. If you are not placed by Day 10, you are essentially a loser.</p>\n<p>Students get no choice of where they want to work at. If you pass their series of coding tests, panel discussions and what not - you are given one offer (if you are blessed then maybe 2-3 offers) and have to make the decision in an hour. No negotiation on what you will be doing, at what location or at what compensation.</p>\n<p>The rebel in me found the system to be dehumanizing, especially for the Top 1% students of the country. As a result, I told myself that I will find a job elsewhere where I will have some idea on what I‚Äôll be working upon and with whom. I did not sign up for campus placements.</p>\n<p>A friend of mine connected me with an employer in Tokyo. The product was Mercari US and the team was pretty diverse. It paid well and many of my friends were already going to Tokyo that year. I interviewed with the CTO, VP of Product and Engineering and my Engineering Manager, and I was in! Again, without traversing a binary tree. The job paid extremely well for a new grad like me. I was set to join them after I graduate. As they say, <em>when it rains, it pours</em>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"life-in-tokyo\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#life-in-tokyo\" aria-label=\"life in tokyo permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Life in Tokyo</h2>\n<p>I was very excited to go to Japan. I found the country to be extremely calm and connected with the roots of human consciousness. It was people, people were hardworking but respectful of each other. Great customer service, free of crime and welcoming. Everyone was somehow aware. Everyone respected elderly and valued wisdom.</p>\n<p>Japan and India only has a timezone difference of about 4 hours. There was plenty of time in the day for me to connect back to family and friends. I made friends there as well, actually a lot of them. I was sharing my apartment with a very good friend of mine from college. Life was amazing!</p>\n<p>Work was great too. I distinctly remember my manager saying - <em>‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt seem like a fresher‚Äù</em>. All because I have been writing real code for 5 years at that point and not traversing binary trees. I knew what a 12 factor app was and how to write effective Database queries that scales up to tens of thousands of daily active users.</p>\n<p>One fine day, I was talking to my ex-manager back from Twitter, who had just moved to Spotify. He told me about <a href=\"https://github.com/backstage/backstage\">Backstage Open Source</a>. It was released just a few days ago, on March 14, 2020. I have always dreamt about writing Open Source software while getting paid for it. He said, <em>‚ÄúHimanshu, just so you know, I would love to work with you again in a heartbeat, if I could.‚Äù</em></p>\n<p>Over the weekend, I got two pull requests merged in the project. It had 50 GitHub stars back then and a few contributors. It is currently at about 30K stars with 1500+ contributors. Interviews happened with Spotify and I knew every single one of my interviewers. In one of those, we forgot to introduce ourselves as we have been talking back and forth on Discord on the same day. I made my way in. Spotify flew me Premium Economy to Stockholm, the land of Opeth and Zlatan Ibrahimovic. That‚Äôs all I knew about Sweden.</p>\n<h2 id=\"life-in-stockholm-and-covid\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#life-in-stockholm-and-covid\" aria-label=\"life in stockholm and covid permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Life in Stockholm and Covid</h2>\n<p>My first summer in Stockholm was my best summer ever. The bar was already high by that point, but I absolutely enjoyed biking every weekend to play football, walking around the rivers, parks and nearby jungles. Stockholm is an interesting landscape, within 5 mins you can reach downtown, a river, a historic place or a cave - it‚Äôs all nearby, everything is.</p>\n<p>Europe values work-life balance like no one else. I still believe if anyone wants to have fun in life and doesn't want to work too hard, get a job in Europe.</p>\n<p>But back then, Covid was at its peak. It didn‚Äôt affect my life in Sweden who was one of the few countries to not implement ban on anything. However, I didn‚Äôt get to see enough of Europe or attended enough concerts as I had hoped for. I only got to travel in my last year, and it was already too late - the dark winters in Stockholm had taken a hit on me.</p>\n<p>Two and half years passed by. I experienced the peak of my career. Got to be known as ‚ÄúThe Backstage Guy‚Äù in the Open Source community. I saw the team grew from 10 to 50 and onboarded many engineers, many of them were far more skilled and experienced than me. I had learned a lot at Spotify and is one of the best companies to be working for as an engineer.</p>\n<p>The timezone difference was not that different either. Again 4 hours and I was able to connect with my family and friends. I found some good friends back there as well. However, during that time, my grandmother passed away. This was the first time I had experienced death in my family. Someone I knew was no more in this world. I was not able to go back in time and mourn with family. Though I was not extremely attached to my grandma, it made me think - <em>what if I had lost someone else, someone far closer to me?</em> It was also the time when I became a lot closer to my lovely childhood friend, who is now my wife. After many years, it made no sense to me to live far from her.</p>\n<p>In all the European and work life glory, something was not working out.</p>\n<h2 id=\"you-know-you-can-come-back-right\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#you-know-you-can-come-back-right\" aria-label=\"you know you can come back right permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a><em>‚ÄúYou know you can come back right?‚Äù</em></h2>\n<p>One fine day, I was sitting in my living room. I had gained about 25 KGs of additional weight in the past year. It was three in the afternoon and the sun had already set. I was on a video call with my dad. We were talking about a few things, one of them being Russia‚Äôs invasion on Ukraine. He was quiet worried about the situations in Europe. I said Sweden had no bone in this fight so don‚Äôt worry about it. But then after the conversation, he was about to hang up, as mom had called for the evening tea. Just then, something hit me and I froze. <em>I was alone in this apartment, middle of nowhere. Why was I not there with them, having that cup of tea?</em></p>\n<p>I broke. Tears streamed down my face and I had no words. What could I have said? That I am an incapable, grown man who can‚Äôt even live on his own? Someone who can‚Äôt move on from family? At that moment, I just wanted to hug my father, but I couldn‚Äôt.</p>\n<p>He kept asking - <em>What happened? Why are you crying? Are you not well?</em></p>\n<p>Silence. I had no words to explain what I was feeling. It was definitely the <em>Chai</em>, now that I think about it. Us Indians, huh.</p>\n<p>After few minutes, he said something that unlocked a door in my perception that I had never opened. He said, <em>‚ÄúYou know you can always come back right? No one is forcing you to live there. You can have an amazing life back in India too.‚Äù</em></p>\n<p>To be honest, I didn‚Äôt know this. I really did not know this! All I knew, was that you are supposed to move abroad when you grow up. Moving abroad is synonymous with being successful, filling up your bank account. It takes your career to the moon and gives you the highest level of status possible among your peers. I thought that was the only, most respectful way.</p>\n<p>The very next day, I wrote an email to my General Manager that I am moving to India. Spotify didn‚Äôt permit engineers to work from India, so I knew this was not going to work out. But at that moment, I just wanted to go back home and hug my father - and no job or salary was going to stop me from doing that.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, Spotify valued the work I was doing with Backstage and exceptionally permitted me to work from India. I was their first R&#x26;D hire here.</p>\n<h2 id=\"back-home\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#back-home\" aria-label=\"back home permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Back home</h2>\n<p>Once I had made the decision to move, I decided to update my friends about it. I put up a WhatsApp status and also made a post on LinkedIn. <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6944645250938241024/\">My post went viral</a> with 5 million views, 28,000 reactions and 900 comments.</p>\n<p>My decision to move back was shocking to many. Many of my friends who lived abroad related to the challenges of loneliness and cultural shock with me. It was also post-Covid era, where many realized remote work is possible and being in the same location all the time is not needed. Startups were blooming, many of them hiring engineering exclusively in India. There was a mass reverse-brain drain happening in that moment, it still is happening, and I am very excited about it!</p>\n<p>I moved back home, starting living in Mumbai with my wife and family. I now get to spend time with my parents without having to plan my days and think about my international travels. Back then, any travel would be 2-4 weeks and there was no room to catchup with an old friend in a different city. I had missed so many reunions, marriages and family events. I now attend them all.</p>\n<p>My mental health has now fully recovered. My physical health is coming along, long way to go still.</p>\n<p>I work remotely at Harness as a Product Manager, the best job I could be doing right now. I fly to Bangalore every quarter to meet my team in person and spend a lot of time with my colleagues in the US over Zoom. I like working late, my most productive hours are 6-10PM. In childhood, this was the time after school where I would sit to study without any distractions. In college, this was the time after classes for club meetups, project discussions or just writing code. Even at work, my most important meetings happen in the evening. Some see it as a cost of living in India, for me this works just fine. Maybe things will change after having kids.</p>\n<h2 id=\"so-why-dont-you-move-abroad-now\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#so-why-dont-you-move-abroad-now\" aria-label=\"so why dont you move abroad now permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>So, why don‚Äôt you move abroad now?</h2>\n<p>I think people should live where they are the happiest. Happiness sparks creativity and is responsible for overall success. Yes, moving to US increases my chances of professional career success, I‚Äôll get to be in proximity with people who have ideas and money to make the ideas come alive. But for me, it comes with significant emotional damage. For some people out there, this is a sacrifice worth making. This was a lot true 20 years ago. The internet age has changed everything. It is now possible to balance career, wealth and happiness while living in India as a techie.</p>\n<p><em>‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you move to the US with your wife? You‚Äôll have family and friends around.‚Äù</em></p>\n<p>Let me put it in a way which doesn‚Äôt offend people - very few of my friends in the US are my real friends. My best friends in US are all planning to move back. My other friends are stuck in the whirlwind of H1Bs and Green Card applications and coping up with their emotional challenges. I wish the best for all of them, but I do not enjoy that lifestyle - it reeks of captivity and not freedom.</p>\n<p><em>‚ÄúIf you plan to start your own company, shouldn‚Äôt you move out of India?‚Äù</em></p>\n<p>Yes I do intend to create a company in the future. And yes, most likely the customers are going to be in the west. However, I have seen enough companies with India based founders that I have full confidence I do not have to move personally to make the company successful. I‚Äôll travel frequently and stay up late - which I already do in some sense. We live in a global internet-enabled world.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs also not that easy. Visas make it extremely hard for Indians to start a company in the US. The whole process makes me want to puke. The Government and popular opinion seems to be heading in an opposite direction. The dehumanizing experience is similar to my take on campus placements in college above.</p>\n<p><em>‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you move temporarily for a few years?‚Äù</em></p>\n<p>Maybe for 3 months, yes. Moving for 2 years is a slippery slope of accepting the emotional damage which I will cause to myself and my wife.

I uplifted many and showed alternate ways to do well in life. At least, for a few dozen people. A path which did not include Grades and meaningless competitive code grinding.</p>\n<p>I think 21st century is a fantastic time to be in a developing nation like India, especially among the tech-enabled hard-working Indians that I know of. I have a lot of hope for my generation. I plan to write more on this in a separate post, when I find time.</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoyed reading through this. If at any point, I have hurt your sentiments, I would like to apologize. This is me expressing my own personal views on this very controversial and emotional topic. I still advise people to choose what‚Äôs best for them, moving abroad is a great option for many who do not carry emotional baggage like me. We all have one life, and we all should do what‚Äôs best for us and our loved ones.

It was a visionary yet strong idea to force all the internal services to communicate with each other via APIs. They were to assume that all services can be externalized in near future.

This platform equips developers with the resources they need to build, test, deploy, and manage applications efficiently, while abstracting away much of the underlying infrastructure complexity.</p>\n<p>By providing a standardized environment, automation capabilities, and reusable components, platform engineering empowers developers to focus on coding and business logic rather than grappling with deployment intricacies or operational concerns.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whats-next\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#whats-next\" aria-label=\"whats next permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>What's next?</h2>\n<p>Further in this series, I will explore</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A brief history of Backstage, another CNCF project among the ranks of Kubernetes and cloud native technologies.</li>\n<li>What is an \"Internal Developer Portal\" and how it is the backbone of any platform org in a company.</li>\n<li>Current state of developer portals and the use-cases</li>\n<li>Future of Platform engineering</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Join me in discussing this revolutionary phase of elevating Developer Experience!</p>","timeToRead":3}},{"node":{"id":"35f22f0a-2485-5bfb-b011-7042d7a2ae17","frontmatter":{"categories":["Tech"],"date":"Oct 2022","draft":false,"slug":"/blog/backstage-internal-developer-portal","subtitle":"A note on why Backstage's plugin architecture makes it the best platform for building Internal Developer Portals","summary":"A note on why Backstage's plugin architecture makes it the best platform for building Internal Developer Portals","title":"Your product either lives long enough to become a platform or it dies out"},"html":"<p><figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative;

It needs to have a way of writing extensions/plugins/apps to extend the product.</p>\n<p>And that is true for almost all of the softwares we use. It‚Äôs true if you really think about it. Think of all the things developers use today.</p>\n<p>Let‚Äôs start with more common examples. Smartphones and Computers. There were some good phones in 2007 but iPhone came and disrupted the market. What was so unique about it? It introduced the possibility of \"writing apps for phones\". And anyone could write them. We now have several billion dollar companies which are technically just apps.</p>\n<p>If iPhone was a batteries included phone, with Apple responsible for creating all the modern apps people use, we wouldn‚Äôt be here today. Same goes for all operating systems like Linux, macOS and Windows. They are all platforms.</p>\n<p>What‚Äôs the next big thing a developer uses? Probably a browser. Even there, you can build chrome extensions, firefox plugins and what not.</p>\n<p>Not to forget some of the most popular websites in the world like youtube, facebook, amazon, twitter, spotify, etc. are conventionally platforms.</p>\n<p>What's next on a developer's minds? GitHub, Gitlab, etc. to host source code? You can build apps and integrations on them. It has it's own marketplace.</p>\n<p>You use VSCode, vim, emacs etc. to write code? People have been building plugins for them for more than 30 years. They have a marketplace too.</p>\n<p>Do you use Slack to communicate? You can build integrations and apps that run on Slack.</p>\n<p>iTerm2 as terminal? zsh as shell?

From your database to your CI provider. From Kubernetes to Docker. From Figma to a Raspberry pi.</p>\n<p>And if any of these products are open source, you can do more than just extending them. You can technically change them from their very core.</p>\n<p>But why is that? Why did iPhones kicked the Motorola-s out of the market? Why would someone prefer a platform where they have to do extra work themselves over choosing an all-inclusive but closed product? The answer varies subjectively with people. To me, it‚Äôs the power that comes with open collaboration. You get more people building great things and sharing with each other, beyond the boundaries of a company or an org. Luckily open source has taught us similar lessons in the past 30 years.</p>\n<p>To sum it up, there is no one-size-fits-all solution for developers.

It‚Äôs an open source project incubating at CNCF.</p>\n<p>An <a href=\"https://internaldeveloperplatform.org/what-is-an-internal-developer-platform/#developer-portal-service-catalog-ui-api-or-cli\">internal developer portal</a> is something that looks different at each company and has different use-cases. For some, it‚Äôs the developer's go-to hub for anything and everything. For some, it‚Äôs their entire catalog of the internal software ecosystem. For some, it‚Äôs their place to read and explore technical documentation. Or a place to launch new software components in the company. And many, many more such use cases.</p>\n<p>Spotify has over 200 plugins inside their Backstage instance to enable additional use cases like A/B testing, user management, inner source, data pipelines, monitoring, deployment tracker and so on.</p>\n<p>All these Backstage plugins inside a company are not built by their core maintainers team - it is federated and built by the experts in their domain.

Aldous Huxley wrote a dystopian classic called Brave New World, which is contemporary to 1984 and has a similar literary significance.

We perceive things around us uniquely. For example, it doesn't matter how close we feel to a person, let it be our partner, a close friend of ours or our parents - each of our perceptions will always be different. And it gets interesting if you think more about it.</p>\n<p>\"We live together, we act on, and react to, one another; but always and in all circumstances we are\nby ourselves. The martyrs go hand in hand into the arena; they are crucified alone. Embraced, the lovers desperately try to fuse their insulated ecstasies into a single self-transcendence; in vain. By its very nature every embodied spirit is doomed to suffer and enjoy in solitude. Sensations, feelings, insights, fancies - all these are private and, except through symbols and at second hand, incommunicable. We can pool information about experiences, but never the experiences themselves. From family to nation, every human group is a society of island universes...\", says Huxley in this book.</p>\n<h2 id=\"reality\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#reality\" aria-label=\"reality permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Reality</h2>\n<p>If someone asks me - what do you mean by reality? I'll say, well, you know the trees grow, flowers bloom, we live on planet Earth, which is round, human beings experience pain and suffering, gravity exists - and the other things that I see in the world.</p>\n<p>In my answer, I only mentioned what is easy for me to say, and can be agreed upon by a lot of people - hopefully everyone. But my complete reality is much larger and has edges which get a bit fuzzier. And I have not grown enough to describe them well, I think.

He basically suggests that we'll never know the <em>absolute reality</em> even if it exists. The tool that helps us cut this \"slice\" is called Perception.</p>\n<p>But the good news is that our perceptions change, or rather expand.

Their doors are locked for us. For example, if you never given birth, you can still talk about parenting but there is so much more still locked for you. And you'll get to unlock that <em>door</em> only when you will raise a child.</p>\n<p>He says that we are caged inside our perceptions, and that there are doors which lead us to new realities. But so far we have opened only a handful of them. And majority of doors are still locked for us - and that too from outside - so it's not possible for us to go and see what's on the other side merely by <em>thinking</em>.</p>\n<p>It takes experiences - or rather \"meaningful experiences\" to unlock these doors.</p>\n<h2 id=\"communication\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#communication\" aria-label=\"communication permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Communication</h2>\n<p>My university campus was beautiful. The trees and the shades of green always blew my mind. Taking frequent walks in the day was one of my favorite activities. For a few years, I thought everyone around me knew it - just because it was obvious for me.</p>\n<p>After reading Huxley and The Doors of Perception, I entered a brief but gloomy phase in life. He basically gave me some uncomfortable realizations that I had to live with. No matter how much I love my parents or my partner, they will never get to know it all. A part of me was getting sadder with more experiences I was having one by one. And it was getting harder for me to communicate <em>everything</em> I felt. I was naive.</p>\n<p>Years have passed and I have made peace with this limitation of life. We can not communicate everything, but we can try! Since then, I started putting more effort into the ways I communicate. Sometimes I speak, write poems, draw analogies from stories - and sometimes I would just send someone a song. I have made peace with the fact that everything can not be conveyed with language. Some things need to be heard, seen and felt.</p>\n<p>Same goes for taking pictures. Don't get me wrong - I think photos are a great way of communicating. But sometimes I respect a view, by not taking a picture. How would you feel if someone took a favorite song of yours, and sang it poorly and offbeat? The same goes for me when I try to capture extraordinary beauty of nature in pixels. It usually happens with mountains, forests, oceans, etc.</p>\n<h2 id=\"art-is-an-attempt-to-communicate\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#art-is-an-attempt-to-communicate\" aria-label=\"art is an attempt to communicate permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Art is an attempt to communicate</h2>\n<p>Art (poetry, music, paintings etc.) are beautiful attempts by human beings to convey their perceptions.

In a healthy open source community, maintainers spend a big chunk of their time reviewing incoming Pull Requests. There are many times when review comments leave me in awe - and I am filled with gratitude. The reviewer wants to have good quality code in the software, but in effect of that, you learn so much more from their insights and experience.</p>\n<p>Ideally, this is one of the those experiences you may get in your internships and first few jobs. But what are the chances of you ending up in such a team? And even if you get one helpful mentor, that's just one. If you stay in Open Source communities, you are constantly learning from numerous of those, and not just in summer for a period of three months.</p>\n<p>Our ways of doing software are heavily biased on the first projects we get involved with. We copy over the ideas to the future, since we know they have worked well. Exposure to multiple Open Source projects break that bias, and exposes us to other newer ways of creating Software.</p>\n<p>I have seen many issues on GitHub describing a problem that seems extremely hard to solve. And when GitHub says, <em>this issue got closed by this specific Pull Request</em> - I feel spoiled that I get to see what that Pull Request did. To have public access to such knowledge is a gift to this community.</p>\n<p>Not everyone studies Computer Science in college. And even if they do, their Software Engineering courses are either missing or outdated to the current day and age. MIT launched a course called - <a href=\"https://missing.csail.mit.edu/\">\"The Missing Semester of Your CS Education\"</a> to address this problem. Computer Science and Software Engineering have grown so much now, that it's impossible to teach both of them in a single curriculum. And the subjects have diverged - It has become Theory vs Practicality, Research vs Industry. Not all but most CS Professors are much closer to the research than the industry, and they expect students to do Open Source projects and internships on their own to gain the industry experience.</p>\n<p>Last but not least, a vast majority of Open Source work is done remote, over the internet, with strangers. The skills required to carry on a remote work become fundamental necessities - good written communication is one of many.</p>\n<h2 id=\"you-escape-the-privilege-barrier\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#you-escape-the-privilege-barrier\" aria-label=\"you escape the privilege barrier permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>You escape the privilege barrier</h2>\n<p>In India, more than a million students graduate engineering courses <em>every year</em>.

In my program I was doing an API request. Irrespective of whether the request was successful, my variable to store the API response was always <code class=\"language-text\">undefined</code>. I was in my first year of college and I expressed my frustration to my brother with <em>\"Javascript sucks\"</em>. All he said was <em>\"Remember, Javascript is asynchronous.\"</em> And that fixed the issue! I still see such problems and they get fixed by the <em>Remember...</em></p>\n<p>Most of the beginners face this problem with Javascript in their early days because Javascript is async in nature.

The I/O (Input/Output) operation for a computer is to talk to other computers. The I/O operation for us is to talk to other people.</p>\n<p>This blocks the main program. It means there is a chunk of time that it takes away from the main program for as long as the blocking execution is being done.</p>\n<p>These I/O operations are necessary for us to survive and communicate. They happen frequently and are also time-consuming. It then becomes important for us to manage them well.</p>\n<p><strong>Living Asynchronously is us making sure our I/O operations are asynchronous most of the time.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"applying-the-philosophy\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#applying-the-philosophy\" aria-label=\"applying the philosophy permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Applying the philosophy</h2>\n<h3 id=\"year-2004-age-7\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#year-2004-age-7\" aria-label=\"year 2004 age 7 permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Year 2004 Age 7</h3>\n<p>I remember in my school, our Maths textbooks used to have many questions in the form of exercises. An exercise was a collection of questions on one topic. There used to be dozens of chapters and hundreds of exercises in a book. The year-long school curriculum and timeline were to make sure all the chapters and their exercises get completed by the students.</p>\n<p>Generally, the entire batch of students is synchronised on what exercise they are doing. Let's say the teacher decides that this week, we are going to complete the Exercise 21 based on the basic Trigonometric formulae. By Monday next week, It is expected of the students to have their notebooks up-to-date. That's how synchronous programming works.</p>\n<p>This model is not great. Not everyone in the class needs to follow the pace set by the teacher for what they deem is suitable for the class.</p>\n<p>When I was in the 3rd standard (age 7), my father started teaching Maths to my elder brother and me. (Fun fact: All three of us now do programming for a living!). It was 2004. In the summer before the school would begin, dad had set the target for me to solve all the problems in the book I was going to study that year. I loved the experience! Although it took a lot of time from my summer vacation, it was rewarding. And I didn't want to stop there. Dad noticed this and bought me the maths textbooks for the following years. And this went on until in the 7th standard, I was doing the problems of the Maths book used in the 10th class.</p>\n<p>If I had followed the synchronous philosophy of the school, I would have to sit around throughout the year, learning not much new. A decade after that time, I would consciously start living asynchronously.</p>\n<h3 id=\"working-in-college-societies\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#working-in-college-societies\" aria-label=\"working in college societies permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Working in college societies</h3>\n<p>Back in college, for five years I was part of a <a href=\"https://wiki.metakgp.org/w/Technology_Literary_Society\">literary society</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kossiitkgp\">a club</a> to promote open source. These were two separate groups and I was an active member of both! In my 3rd/4th year, I was part of the so called \"executive batch\". We were 4-5 people responsible to execute the events organized by 30-50 of us members, for the hundreds of students on campus to attend.</p>\n<p>Before we organized any event (a poetry night, an open mic, a Python or a GSoC workshop, etc.), I as the organizer needed to sync with all the members helping out. There are many operations that need to be taken care of, like logistics, publicity, poster distribution, members' performances/talks, communication with external members, finances, etc. If I remember correctly, I had burnt out early in the year. I had to sync with so many people during the days of the actual event. I valued the event's success not much by its attendance, but a lot by how we did it and the things we learned in the process.</p>\n<p>Lets take the task of poster distribution. The job was to print a bunch of posters for the event that had its details, description, contact, venue, time, etc. and paste it across the college campus so that other students would notice. From the team, I would assign one person to take care of this. This meant that they were responsible for going to the printing press, getting the copies done, and then with the help of other members, putting them up across the campus. Given I had other equally important tasks to take care of, it was a nightmare to contact all the people involved in this particular task. But, I couldn't just \"assign and forget\" the task to someone because, if he or she decided to slack off, it would disrupt the event. This has happened quite many times as I remember. So, I started identifying people I could trust, who shared the passion of the work and cared. And then, living asynchronously was easy and the only sane way to go about it.</p>\n<p><em>Then on, all my instructions and tasks had their <em>callbacks</em>. And if someone else asked me to do something, I would ask them to write their <em>callback</em> i.e. tell me what to do when I'm done with this. I reduced many unnecessary \"blocking\" I/O operations from my life, resulting in a much relaxed life.</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"whatsapp-message-seen-tick\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#whatsapp-message-seen-tick\" aria-label=\"whatsapp message seen tick permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>WhatsApp message \"seen\" tick</h3>\n<p>Many years ago Facebook started showing things like \"message seen at 10:10 AM\" in their chatbox. This was the first time I saw something like this. Earlier, messaging someone was much like sending a very short email - you didn't expect a response within a minute. Instant communication started catching up and now there is a product called \"mail tracker\" which tells you when and how many times your email was read.</p>\n<p>I have disabled the blue seen tick in WhatsApp and I have a <a href=\"/blog/delete-facebook/\">dummy facebook account</a>. This means, I don't get to know when my message was read and the other person doesn't know when I read their message. This is me, trying to reduce \"synchronous\" communication from life, as it introduces more problems than it solves.</p>\n<p>If someone <em>sees</em> my message, I never ought to expect an instant response. I have no idea what they are doing in their \"main program\". They could be in a thought process, talking with someone else, working on something, or be in one of a thousand different possibilities. So \"seen at 10:10 AM\" gives me no information. It instead triggers me to think - <em>why have they not replied yet</em>.</p>\n<p>If I want to have a synchronous conversation, I would set up a call at the convenience of both of us. That is much efficient in every aspect. By not having to worry about replying instantly and not expecting someone to do so, I have freed a lot of time that I used to waste in waiting for the response.</p>\n<h3 id=\"relationships-and-behaviour\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#relationships-and-behaviour\" aria-label=\"relationships and behaviour permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Relationships and Behaviour</h3>\n<p>If I have the freedom of my thoughts, asynchrony is associated with freedom.</p>\n<p>If our actions and words demand synchronous response from the other person, it directly impacts their time. It affects how they want to spend it. Doing it way often is not nice. And it is a kind gesture to respect their time and do less synchronous communication. Allowing someone to be free is a great expression of love and it makes us better humans.</p>\n<p>I would be crazy to say that all synchronous communications are bad. That would be insane. What I do is reduce the frequency, and increase the time to generate more value. And of course, do lots of async stuff. :)</p>\n<h3 id=\"blog-post-vs-notifications\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#blog-post-vs-notifications\" aria-label=\"blog post vs notifications permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Blog post vs Notifications</h3>\n<p>A blog post is a shining example of communicating asynchronously in this world.</p>\n<p>This blog post does not demand anything from you. You can close it as soon as you opened it, read it now, a week later or next year. I have no expectation of knowing whether you read it or not, unless you want to let me know. I enjoy writing and reading them. They do not feel \"instant\". They do not say \"just now\" or \"posted a minute ago\". As Quincy Larson says - all notifications are synchronous. Social media wants to notify me if someone has said something publicly. Facebook/Instagram/Twitter wants to keep me in \"sync\" with what all my friends are doing.

When I started working, I had the challenge of adopting the same philosophy at work. I knew it would be challenging because people have their own style of working. But I tried my best to keep this philosophy alive with me.</p>\n<p>If I would have technical queries to ask, most of them would be Email or Slack and few in-person. As I understood the team and the technologies better over time, I would change all my questions to being asynchronous. That kept everyone involved a bit happier. The person who'd write the answer, would do so in their free time. Hence the responses had more details and helped me more than what a disrupting synchronous question would have done.</p>\n<p>When a project is newborn, synchronous communication between the stakeholders and engineers is necessary and valuable. They help avoid confusion and misunderstandings. But as the tasks start being granular, sync-meetings begin losing their value.</p>\n<p>If a project has grown large and has no documentation, there is no way asynchronous communication is possible even after months or years. The few people who created it, are going to waste more time answering questions, which they should have written in the form of documentation ages ago.</p>\n<p>Generally, product managers love to talk about projects in team meetings. Why won't they? They have a vision and want to share. But a wise engineering manager would come and ask, \"Can this information be shared via an email?\". This is a smart question to ask each time because it not only promotes written documentation but saves time for the involved engineers. They got time to focus and pay more attention to the work, which would have been disrupted by a synchronous meeting.</p>\n<p>Similar to blog posts, Documentation of projects and code is a light beam of hope in the asynchronous life. If I can find the documentation to read, it drastically reduces the amount of synchronous communication involved to solve my problem. And since a tap on the shoulder in not possible when working remotely, more written communication is the way to go!</p>\n<h3 id=\"tldr-too-long-didnt-read\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#tldr-too-long-didnt-read\" aria-label=\"tldr too long didnt read permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>TLDR (Too long, didn't read)</h3>\n<p>Living Asynchronously is inspired by the concept of asynchronous programming and Javascript's callbacks and promises. Synchronous life events are blocking in nature, are inefficient and time-consuming. It is not always possible, but living asynchronous life has its benefits and is a great way to live.</p>\n<p>I believe this philosophy is easy to understand and can be applied on many aspects of life. I encourage you to think on your own and identify the synchronous events in life. And then imagine how living asynchronously would feel.</p>","timeToRead":10}},{"node":{"id":"2f4bda2a-00d3-5618-927c-6ebdc382eb8b","frontmatter":{"categories":["letters"],"date":"Jun 2020","draft":false,"slug":"/letters/letter-with-no-subject-1","subtitle":"","summary":"","title":"Letter with no subject"},"html":"<h2 id=\"name-retracted-wrote--\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#name-retracted-wrote--\" aria-label=\"name retracted wrote   permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>:name-retracted: wrote -</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hi Himanshu,</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Congratulations from the bottom of my heart for joining Spotify. We really miss you at college. You're one of the few seniors at KGP from whom I got really influenced in making changes in my life. I've been thinking of writing a letter to you since a few months as a chat/talk cannot convey the message with proper bandwidth. I wanted to talk about a lot of things. There isn't a purpose per se. If there's one thing I regret now that would be making myself away from you guys during my first year because of the intoxicated activities xD. I used to judge people blindly on the basis of their habits and think my parents are always right. As I grow up, I realise that not a single one has any idea of what they're doing in their life, how things progress and end. Everyone learns from their experiences and they think if they could change a decision that they took in the past, they could've avoided some problems in the present but that would erase a lot of things they've gained from their problems. This statement came from a show that I've watched recently called Dark by Netflix. I've been reading a lot of psychology recently and I realised that everyone who I thought was doing good has a lot of insecurities and they keep doing things having faith in their values, finding happiness in their small wins after the hardships and it's beautiful.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I'm getting confused a lot recently. I watched a show called Bojack Horseman and it was so depressing. Whenever I watch a single episode, I used to relate myself to the character who is a horse which always says things about life in a doomer way. I decided to read whenever I'm confused and not feel bad about feeling bad about myself. Whenever I feel like reading something, I either take my kindle or read an article from the internet. I've read your blog posts and letters multiple times and each time I read, I get a new insight. Thanks for writing those. I'm always intrigued by the way you write things in your blog. I hope that's how you think. It's really minimal and the flow of thoughts is incredibly linear. I read a book called Think Straight by Darius Foroux last year and it feels simple to do that, but not easy. I was curious to know how I think and how contaminated my thoughts are. I recently did a dopamine detox. It's more than a digital detox. I stayed away from my laptop, phone, television, kindle, instant gratification activities, talking with people, tea/coffee, etc. for 24 hours. Things I did were meditating and documenting my thoughts. Documentation of thoughts to clear the mind and to learn how you think is called brain vomit. I read about this somewhere from the internet. I always used to reset myself once in a week by smoking up and it does just the opposite of dopamine detox. But this thing was hard. I ended up meditating thrice. I didn't use an app or a specific technique per se. I was just accepting my thoughts by closing my eyes. So 3x1hr sessions. From the very next day, I felt fresh and relieved. I could do anything I was struggling with before. That frustration whenever I stuck while coding up a problem, the difficulties I faced while reading research papers which made me think about my lack of understanding capacity and whatnot - every distraction was just gone. I did my workout for 1hr followed by the remote work I've been trying to do and read my kindle in between. That day was beautiful. It went exactly as I planned but when I tried to sleep at night, I just couldn't sleep. The next day I wasn't insisting to do anything per se. Just did the things I felt like doing but I turned off the push notifications on my phone and used the internet when it was necessary only. I could sleep at that night very well. I felt interesting to experiment the things out of the books I read about habits. This doesn't seem to be the one suitable for me. I should adapt slowly by accepting my imperfections I feel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I'm closing this letter with this last paragraph. This is about things just getting right and suddenly everything goes wrong but still managing to breathe. When I visited New York for a code sprint last year, I was mind blown by the things I saw there. I wanted to visit the US again. I'd dreamed of settling there. So, I started working hard with the research and it took more than two months to get two of the FTs accepted with funding. There are long stories behind that. But that would make this letter even longer. So, I'm omitting those. I'd to setup my BTP also and I wanted to do that in CS dept. I sent mails to some profs, some didn't reply, some replied negatively and one replied positively asking me to meet him in the office. I'd hopes on him but he humiliated me instead there. I was like I am not good enough, I should be doing most of the people are doing and couldn't aim big. On the last date of application submission, I mailed a prof who didn't even reply once before and was not found in his office whenever I tried to meet him. I mailed him just for the sake of it as my facad told me that he would extend the deadline if I forward him a mail to a prof asking for BTP. Unexpectedly, he agreed to mentor me. Suddenly everything felt like were going exactly as I planned. The very next day US declared emergency because of covid and I just can't go there for my summers. They agreed to mentor me remotely though. I reached home just before the lockdown and it's been two months now. My parents are really happy to have me around. They're afraid of me getting away from them. It's really hard to work from home. This covid made me afraid to settle abroad and still got me confused. This letter turned out to be really long and contain a lot of personal information. I didn't do that on purpose.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Regards,</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"i-responded--\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#i-responded--\" aria-label=\"i responded   permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>I responded -</h2>\n<p>Hi :name-retracted:,</p>\n<p>Thank you for writing this letter. Also, thank you for opening up and sharing the thoughts from your mind. This is a rare pleasure. Let me try to reciprocate! :)</p>\n<p>I first saw you on a Metakgp demo day event and I have been fascinated by you since then. Those were the early years of KOSS. I was looking for people in KGP who resonated with the idea. I would always carry a mental model of students with me who were perfect for a community like KOSS and people who would definitely enjoy being there. What you were in your first year, soon became the face of my mental model.</p>\n<p>With your experience, intellect and ability to communicate, you are easily someone I wanted to be in my first year. I am glad our efforts and the people involved in the KGP Open Source community fascinated you and now we are close.</p>\n<p>What you wrote above related to intoxication made me so excited! They have been some of my favourite topics to talk about. Externally it looks like a conversation about having a drink early in college, but the bigger picture is more about waking up.</p>\n<p>I believe most of us in our first year are not awake in many senses. Just after the restless two years of the grand exam preparation, we are not ready to own our thoughts and actions. We eagerly seek advice, for someone to answer us -- What now?. We are sensitive and vulnerable to our surroundings. Some of us use the words of our parents and guardians as the governing principles of our life. Some of us blindly follow the first few seniors that we meet and spend our whole college life doing things which we wouldn't have done otherwise. This is harmful in many ways but not necessarily bad for everyone.</p>\n<p>Talking about life in college, I am currently reading <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11084145-steve-jobs\">Steve Jobs biography by Walter Isaacson</a>. The pages about his college life are inspiring to me. I would not do everything that he used to do (Extreme diets, sleeplessness, not showering, being rude to parents/people in general), but his energy and attitude towards life defined him in those moments.</p>\n<p>The young students of IITs refusing to do some things which the society has asked them not to do, is a grey area to talk about. Without forcing anything on them, I would instead share one of these questions that I asked myself very early in college.</p>\n<p><em>Am I thinking for myself?</em></p>\n<p><em>Do I question everything?</em></p>\n<p><em>How important is it for me to solve this assignment?</em></p>\n<p><em>What difference will it make if I get a B instead of A or EX grade?</em></p>\n<p><em>Is this the best use of my time?</em></p>\n<p><em>Do I have the right people around me?</em></p>\n<p><em>Are my friendships healthy? Am I exploring the depths of my relationships?</em></p>\n<p><em>Do I love the work that I do or want to do in future?</em></p>\n<p>Good news is that a lot of us start thinking for ourselves sooner or later. But to do it as early as possible is an amazing experience and shows us the parts of life which we couldn't have seen otherwise. To sum it up, I am not directly promoting drinking and smoking up in college. Doing it mindlessly has bad consequences for most of us. They are nothing but a medium for us to start living a free life in a higher state of consciousness. What you have written above about the realisation and acceptance makes you brave, and you should see it this way.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your words about my blog. I am influenced by <a href=\"http://paulgraham.com/talk.html\">Paul Graham's Write Like You Talk essay</a>. I was in the literary society back in college and I would see writers complicate their pieces by trying to write in a very different, unreal way, which they thought is aesthetic. At the same time, I was fascinated by the poems and proses which were easy to comprehend but much harder to fully understand. Talking about Paul Graham, my favourite essay from him is called <a href=\"http://paulgraham.com/vb.html\">Life is Short</a>. I keep getting back to this essay every couple months. It is heartfelt advice for people of our age.</p>\n<p>Lovely to hear about your full day dopamine detox. Damn, I could never do it now. If my mother tried calling me on Whatsapp and I wouldn't respond in an hour or two, she will start getting worried. But, I respect the idea. I am also fascinated by the 10 days Vipassana meditation course where we eat less, live in silence and do Vipassana meditation 10 hours per day, to witness thoughts and sensations come and go.</p>\n<p>I remember that you quit Facebook too. It is amazing how we want to spend a healthy life by being mindful about all the dopamine agents around us. I think one of the worst habits of people (including me) is that we do not respect the time between waking up in the morning and us connecting and catching up with the internet. That period of time determines how the rest of our day will go. Some people call it having a slow morning, which is doing slow, mundane things in that block of time. It includes things like making coffee, making our bed, washing dishes, showering, staring outside at the morning sun, etc. This slowness boosts our energy for the rest of the day. For me, nothing is worse than getting up from bed and scrolling Twitter for 10 minutes straight. That dials down my tempo for hours in the day. You can read more about \"Slow Morning\" on the internet.</p>\n<p>I am personally sad to see the effects of COVID-19 on the college students. I feel sad that you didn't get to experience the internship in the US. But I'm happy to know that you got to work remotely!</p>\n<p>Your story with the professors back in KGP is disappointing. For me, it has been a vicious circle of me skipping classes and me not learning anything from my professors. The segregation of departments and disciplines is a legacy model and affects many students who want to study subjects outside of our assigned departments.</p>\n<p>Let me end by mentioning a letter from Richard Feynman called <a href=\"https://lettersofnote.com/2015/10/23/do-not-remain-nameless-to-yourself/\">Do not remain nameless to yourself</a>. He wrote this to one of his PhD students after winning the Nobel Prize. You might have read this already. It is inspiring for people in Science and Technology. Barriers like nasty professors or broken interview systems will not stop you and me from accomplishing what we want to do. \"No problem is too small or too trivial if we can really do something about it.\" Someone as skilful as you should grow thick skin for them and keep working on things that you love. I know you love solving problems and creating software. It should be all that is important.</p>\n<p>Definitely enjoy the time at home with family. Let's keep in touch.</p>","timeToRead":9}},{"node":{"id":"f9b08919-1926-5365-ba16-9756ddfdad25","frontmatter":{"categories":["Tech"],"date":"May 2020","draft":false,"slug":"/blog/spotify","subtitle":"Thoughts on Japan, my principles of work and what lies ahead.","summary":"I have written about living in Japan, my work principles and what lies ahead.","title":"Joining Spotify in Sweden"},"html":"<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 2362px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 29.92%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAGCAYAAADDl76dAAAACXBIWXMAAC4jAAAuIwF4pT92AAAA0UlEQVQY033Qv0qCYRgF8F/SUFOjNPfnEgQHFwdrK3CKLiArhELBRYUIvAOhlpAgUCK6Abemlpps6BaaShCiofjwKRy+PNPDc95znvMepmjhA1+4wrJ0ZPyPP+4II/RxhzdcBldAMUW8gA3ksIu1WfIJXVRQwyme49EFjnEQ+0R8iAZuIswjTrCFfGL4giGaaGOAMVaxh3vchuFDHOhFiA7OQpdUtZgYVvGNd7ziE9eRvoQdnGMf2Tiyju2oZBN1lGe/3YjuJtHfUkpn87DyO/0A/AEoMwETdC4AAAAASUVORK5CYII='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n          <source\n              srcset=\"/static/c97391051b6b4cbe34d7a1bfe040d88d/529ab/spotify.webp 625w,\n/static/c97391051b6b4cbe34d7a1bfe040d88d/74e35/spotify.webp 1250w,\n/static/c97391051b6b4cbe34d7a1bfe040d88d/5d4cc/spotify.webp 2362w\"\n              sizes=\"(max-width: 2362px) 100vw, 2362px\"\n              type=\"image/webp\"\n            />\n          <source\n            srcset=\"/static/c97391051b6b4cbe34d7a1bfe040d88d/b1b4f/spotify.png 625w,\n/static/c97391051b6b4cbe34d7a1bfe040d88d/161f7/spotify.png 1250w,\n/static/c97391051b6b4cbe34d7a1bfe040d88d/e1cb3/spotify.png 2362w\"\n            sizes=\"(max-width: 2362px) 100vw, 2362px\"\n            type=\"image/png\"\n          />\n          <img\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n            src=\"/static/c97391051b6b4cbe34d7a1bfe040d88d/e1cb3/spotify.png\"\n            alt=\"spotify\"\n            title=\"spotify\"\n            loading=\"lazy\"\n            decoding=\"async\"\n            style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n          />\n        </picture>\n    </span>\n<a href=\"https://newsroom.spotify.com/media-kit/logo-and-brand-assets/\"><em>Image source</em></a></p>\n<h2 id=\"life-in-japan\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#life-in-japan\" aria-label=\"life in japan permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Life in Japan</h2>\n<p>All the things that I knew about Japan turned out to be true, as soon as I arrived here 8 months ago.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Japan is a <strong>beautiful</strong> place to live! The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry_blossom\">cherry blossoms</a> season just started. There is a lot of nature surrounding downtown Tokyo. I haven't experienced the peak of summer here yet, but the cold climate has been cherry on top of it all.</p>\n<p>I spent five years in my college campus where you could spot trees from anywhere (my hostel room, classrooms and the roads). Having all this nature around me once again was a relief.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Most <strong>people are mindful, quiet and private</strong>. This is great for those who want to live a private life. I believe my friends and I used to be the only ones talking in the entire freaking train.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Delicacies</strong>! I don't remember having a bad meal ever. The proportion size and the amount of calories are thoughtfully decided. The meals are prioritized to be healthy <em>and</em> tasty. This is not true for many countries.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Japan is very <strong>safe</strong>. I know many of my friends never locked their apartments before going out (bad idea). Walking outside late at nights does not feel threatening. I am raised to be careful about incoming traffic and being stoic about what could go wrong. Certainly, I have never had any bad experience. I didn't encounter any homeless people either.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The city is mostly clean. People do not enter anyone's house with their shoes on. There is almost zero vandalism.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <strong>customer service</strong> can not be imagined and replicated easily in other societies of the world. I know and have heard that people in India are very helpful. I felt people in Japan sometimes do <em>beyond normal</em> things for their customers. People take their jobs very seriously. The entire bank staff greets you when you come in. You will not be left unattended even for a minute. And everyone will say Thank you and keep bowing until you get out of the door and disappear. My God, I used to feel bad.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The not-so-good things that I had heard are also true!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Language barrier</p>\n<p>You can get by in Tokyo if you don't know Japanese and have friends whom you can talk to. But my life was of a <em>tourist</em> and was limited in social terms. Essential shopping (groceries, etc.) becomes limited. I have to show an image and hope that the person can recognize what I am asking for. Using a public service e.g. Hospitals, courier service is hard. I can not enquire what I want to. Google Translate is barely helpful, and is useless most of the times.</p>\n<p>Many people learn Japanese after coming here. They see a life here and want to settle. As of now, I know I only want to <em>settle</em> in India and maybe in an English speaking country. My work required no Japanese, hence I did not learn. Instead I invested my time in learning new paradigms of programming in a large company.

I got inspired by it. I took the concepts of Promises and callbacks in Javascript on a philosophical level.</p>\n<p>Working Synchronously is the easy option. Async is hard to code and to practice in real life.</p>\n<p>Living async means writing negligible number of messages/emails which require you to constantly wait until there is response. They block you from continuing to work on something else. Living async means lesser number of unimportant meetings and sync ups. In fact, when I used to be stuck in the beginning, I used to write my doubts as long expressive messages and would not expect a response immediately. I think I learnt this from the Open Source communities. ;)</p>\n<p><em>Edit: Some folks asked me on twitter to elaborate on this, so I wrote a follow up blog post about <a href=\"https://orkohunter.net/blog/live-asynchronously/\">living asynchronously</a>.</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"working-concurrently\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#working-concurrently\" aria-label=\"working concurrently permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Working concurrently</h3>\n<p>I always took two or more concurrent (independent) tasks at the same time. If I get blocked or maybe bored with the first task, I would switch to the second one and would wait until I get unblocked. It is not feasible when the first task is huge. But even then, it can be broken down into chunks of concurrent pieces. And then, I would \"parallelly process\" them on my end.</p>\n<h3 id=\"writing-daily-notes\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#writing-daily-notes\" aria-label=\"writing daily notes permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Writing daily notes</h3>\n<p>I used to take notes aggressively when I started working. I would write more than 100 words each day. I would publish them on an internal Confluence space.</p>\n<p>The main reasons for doing this were -</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>We forget</strong>. The meetings with our managers, mentors and coworkers in our first month are crucial. They convey some of the most important things about the company, team, project, etc. It was important for me to write <em>all</em> of it down.</li>\n<li><strong>Self review</strong>. At the end of the day, I would go through my notes and publish a summary of things I did, things I learnt, etc. It would take 10 minutes each day. My quarterly self reviews used to be very very long and exhaustive, since I had the logs of what I did. After six months, I changed the frequency of publishing the logs to weekly, but I would still take daily private notes.</li>\n<li><strong>Being public</strong>. My page was easily accessible by visiting <code class=\"language-text\">go/himanshu</code> from inside the company. I loved that I was being transparent about how I am spending my time in the company. And it also helped my indirect co-workers to know what I do here.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"docs-docs-code-docs-docs-technical-specs\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#docs-docs-code-docs-docs-technical-specs\" aria-label=\"docs docs code docs docs technical specs permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Docs, docs. code. docs. docs.

Check it out, you'll find it interesting. <a href=\"https://backstage.io/\">backstage.io</a></p>\n<p>I am personally very excited that I will get to work closely with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/decause/\">Remy Decausemaker</a> again.

Teams (Squads) have autonomy of the work they do. People share knowledge and support collaboration and individual growth. I intend to stay in the company for long and hopefully I come out as a much better engineer.</p>\n<p>Plus, Spotify is a product that I have been using for many years.

The name of the method is key to what do they do.</p>\n<p>In BFS, we search all the neighbour nodes first. And then search the 2nd-degree neighbours, then 3rd-degree, and so on.
