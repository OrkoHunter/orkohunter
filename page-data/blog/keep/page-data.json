Problem Solved !\nFast forward couple weeks, Writwick has to do X in terminal, again. Wraj remembers solving this few weeks ago. Let him do a reverse-i-search with <em>Ctrl+R</em>. Nope, can’t remember sh*t. Browser search history? 25 web pages found matching *X*. Argh!\nWritwik finally finds the solution. From this time Writwik starts writing the commands somewhere online for the future.\nWait, why shouldn’t he keep the command in his terminal itself if this is only place where he’ll ever have use it?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"/f1944495e4b7f20b8ca279cc8e4d8d2d/1*A4bHZhazEzT2giYA-djLmA.gif\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Introducing a new command line tool which solves the issue of memorizing commands or storing them somewhere which is difficult to find.
