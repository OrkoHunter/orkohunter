You’re back home after a night out with friends. A couple of beers and some pizza. The place was too loud but you still managed to have a conversation. Maybe about cricket, football, or some half-serious romantic interest. But some part of your brain kept reminding you that tomorrow is Monday, <em>again</em>.</p>\n<p>On the way home, you open Zerodha or Robinhood to check up upon your stocks and mutual funds. <em>“Gotta keep the grind on”</em>, you said to yourself. After mindlessly scrolling through some reels and sending it to your friends, you fall asleep.</p>\n<p>This is life for most tech workers today, in Bangalore, London, the Bay Area, New York or Berlin. Regular life, for most single people in their 20s. For those in 30s, add the search for a life partner and EMI stress. Everything else stays the same.</p>\n<p><strong>How did we get here?</strong> We used to be bright-eyed, curious, building things in college rooms or scribbling new ideas in our notebooks. Now we’re calendar-bound adults who feel guilty for thinking about work on a Sunday, but also feel unproductive on a Monday. Wednesdays often make us question our life decisions.</p>\n<p>Where did that creative joy go? When did the artist in all of us <em>die</em>? Does it have to be like this for the rest of our lives?</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-8-8-8-rule\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-8-8-8-rule\" aria-label=\"the 8 8 8 rule permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The 8-8-8 Rule</h2>\n<p><strong>“Work-life balance” is a broken phrase</strong>. It suggests that <em>work</em> and <em>life</em> are two opposite forces. Like the opposite ends of a seasaw.</p>\n<p>We forget that 8-hour shifts and time clocks were only invented a few centuries ago, to keep the factories running. In the Industrial Revolution, it made sense for the factory jobs that needed 24x7 shifts to keep the machines running. Most of those jobs, no longer exist as more and more machines are designed to operate independently with little to no supervision.</p>\n<p>But most likely your job isn’t in a factory. And \"the machines\" you operate don’t need you 24x7. Most of them are built to run without you. In tech, most of the mundane, manual work is disappearing.</p>\n<p>So why are we still obsessed with 9 to 5? And carving out a single chunk of 8 hours each day for something that doesn't feel part of life?</p>\n<span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 1024px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/a5655a7178a6805f9f2be89670a4a3f4/42a19/a-typical-day.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 100%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <picture>\n          <source srcset=\"/static/a5655a7178a6805f9f2be89670a4a3f4/529ab/a-typical-day.webp 625w,\n/static/a5655a7178a6805f9f2be89670a4a3f4/d71bc/a-typical-day.webp 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" type=\"image/webp\">\n          <source srcset=\"/static/a5655a7178a6805f9f2be89670a4a3f4/b1b4f/a-typical-day.png 625w,\n/static/a5655a7178a6805f9f2be89670a4a3f4/42a19/a-typical-day.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" type=\"image/png\">\n          <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" src=\"/static/a5655a7178a6805f9f2be89670a4a3f4/42a19/a-typical-day.png\" alt=\"a typical day\" title=\"a typical day\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\">\n        </picture>\n  </a>\n    </span>\n<p>Some people work best at 6 AM, others can feel the flow state after sunset. Why is this not the norm? Teams can still have a few shared hours, say 10 AM to 2 PM, and leave the rest flexible. For globally distributed companies, there’s no perfect answer. Just build a truly async culture ground up but have human interactions when needed. Get together in person when it matters. Gain trust by showing ownership. Trust beats micromanagement. I have written more about this in detail in one of my previous posts called <a href=\"/blog/live-asynchronously\">Live Asynchronously</a>. But this post is more than just async work.</p>\n<h2 id=\"extremes-exist-on-both-sides\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#extremes-exist-on-both-sides\" aria-label=\"extremes exist on both sides permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Extremes Exist on Both Sides</h2>\n<p>We love to call out the <em>workaholics</em>, people who sacrifice health, family, and everything else to get ahead. But let’s also talk about the other extreme, people who check out the moment the clock hits 5, talk more about their CTC and office gossip at dinners rather than the craft of building something new. They never touch a line of code or attend a conference outside work. There is no joy left in them. Their mind's in one place, heart in another.</p>\n<p>I’ve had first-hand experiences with both the types. To be honest, I have had more meaningful relationships with the workaholics. Early in your career, you need to go all in. Experiment. Obsess. Stay up till 3 AM debugging if you want to. That’s not toxic hustle, that’s what falling in love with your craft looks like.</p>\n<p>I remember my first few months at Spotify. I was debugging an unexpected authentication bug on a Friday. I hadn’t proven myself yet, and so I wanted to earn the team’s trust. I went deep - JWT, user identity flows - understood everything over the weekend. By Monday, I had the PR ready!</p>\n<p>At the standup, my favorite engineer said, <em>“Nice work, man.”</em> It meant the world to me. However, another one sort of joked - <em>“Well, now we all have to catch up because Himanshu has worked over the weekend.”</em></p>\n<p>For me, that weekend was more meaningful than any trip or party I could’ve gone on to. I was lit up. That’s what I want more people to feel, every once in a while. As Charles Bukowski would say, <em>go all the way</em>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dont-just-work-care-about-what-you-build\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#dont-just-work-care-about-what-you-build\" aria-label=\"dont just work care about what you build permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Don’t Just Work. Care About What You Build.</h2>\n<p>Yes, some people work only for money. It's okay and I get it. Especially if you’re supporting a family or coming from a tough background.</p>\n<p>But if you have the luxury of choice, why not choose well? Pick a problem that excites you. Join a team that shares your values. Work with people who give a damn and have a taste. We all get one life.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, you’ll keep dragging yourself through another Monday. Waiting for Friday like it’s a savior.

As we grow older, we don't find much time. So, as you are sitting with your child, instead of scrolling through the phone, play along with them. Similarly, when at work, don't just fill hours, solve something real. Automate the boring stuff. Volunteer for the good problems, ask for it. Switch to a better, more interesting project. If it's not possible to do that in your current company, move on to a different one. It sounds hard, but it’s worth it.</p>\n<p>Balance is important, but it's not a balance between <em>Work</em> and <em>Life</em> - it's the balance between the things you do for yourself and for others around you.</p>\n<p>Don’t aim for balance.

I was in the third year. I was surrounded by two junior batches and two senior batches in the same party. And being the <em>elected governor</em> of the club, my job was to ensure that the younger ones learn and have a good time with the seniors.</p>\n<p>On this one particular night, a lot of people were bonding, and it was amazing. But then I saw this young boy sitting in the corner by himself. Let’s call him Aditya. It was a bit dark and Aditya was trying to just get by, unnoticed. He looked overwhelmed and disinterested. I went up to him with a big smile and a lot of kindness, and said - <em>“Hey man, what’s up? Why don’t you approach and talk to a few here? They are friendly, you know. You like Open Source, so maybe talk to that guy (pointing to a senior of mine) and ask him how he got started.”.</em></p>\n<p>His response that day still echoes in my ear. It felt like a voice coming out of a closed heart. And my words had fallen flat on him. He said, with a smirk, “<em>I am not an extrovert</em>”.</p>\n<p>I looked into his eyes and saw the disgust for everyone in the room. Aditya was a proud introvert, as I like to call them. Little did he know that most people in that club were introverts, true nerds. They would rather sit in front of the computer than go out during the yearly college social fest. Yet, Aditya thought he is unique and does not belong there. Later that year, Aditya left the club.</p>\n<p>I have met a lot of Adityas in life. They sit quietly in one group, but are the loudest in another. They use introversion as an excuse to not grow. What they don’t realize is - everyone is an introvert and everyone is an extrovert.

But there are two big challenges with this. First, people don’t know what that means. Does being an extrovert at work mean you need to shout “Good morning!” to everyone like a human alarm clock? No, but if you want to try, let me know how that works out. Does it mean I should be shouting in every single meeting? Does it mean I get to speak the most in conversations?</p>\n<p>The second challenge is the misconception that communication should be natural and effortless. While the reality is, it takes effort to communicate and drains energy for everyone. Most speakers and developer advocates (I have been one) often enjoy the calmness when the meeting gets over. People don’t realize everyone is putting in some effort, even though it may not feel that way.</p>\n<h2 id=\"its-a-skill-learn-and-practice-it-like-a-skill\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#its-a-skill-learn-and-practice-it-like-a-skill\" aria-label=\"its a skill learn and practice it like a skill permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>It’s a skill, learn and practice it like a skill</h2>\n<p>Let me start by saying that work is not a social club. Everything you do at work is part of work. Talking to your colleagues about their life? It’s part of work. You are building relationships which will help you out sometime later. No matter what role you play, you will always have to communicate and collaborate with others.

Here’s a summary anyway.</p>\n<p>Our brains have two modes when it comes to making decisions. There is a fast part of the brain which makes most of the day-to-day decisions in an autopilot mode. For example, when brushing teeth, you don’t plan out what quadrant of the teeth you should begin with. It all just happens while you think about the delicious breakfast you’ll be having later.</p>\n<p>Slow thinking requires significantly higher energy, but is responsible for most of the learning and high quality work that you produce. Since fast thinking requires less energy, the brain ideally wants to do everything in this mode.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 2500px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/73a5c6cbfe929a2a47379c1d7b72919c/669c9/quadrants.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 65.27999999999999%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n          <source\n              srcset=\"/static/73a5c6cbfe929a2a47379c1d7b72919c/529ab/quadrants.webp 625w,\n/static/73a5c6cbfe929a2a47379c1d7b72919c/74e35/quadrants.webp 1250w,\n/static/73a5c6cbfe929a2a47379c1d7b72919c/f3963/quadrants.webp 2500w,\n/static/73a5c6cbfe929a2a47379c1d7b72919c/9225b/quadrants.webp 2897w\"\n              sizes=\"(max-width: 2500px) 100vw, 2500px\"\n              type=\"image/webp\"\n            />\n          <source\n            srcset=\"/static/73a5c6cbfe929a2a47379c1d7b72919c/b1b4f/quadrants.png 625w,\n/static/73a5c6cbfe929a2a47379c1d7b72919c/161f7/quadrants.png 1250w,\n/static/73a5c6cbfe929a2a47379c1d7b72919c/6482f/quadrants.png 2500w,\n/static/73a5c6cbfe929a2a47379c1d7b72919c/669c9/quadrants.png 2897w\"\n            sizes=\"(max-width: 2500px) 100vw, 2500px\"\n            type=\"image/png\"\n          />\n          <img\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n            src=\"/static/73a5c6cbfe929a2a47379c1d7b72919c/6482f/quadrants.png\"\n            alt=\"quadrants\"\n            title=\"quadrants\"\n            loading=\"lazy\"\n            decoding=\"async\"\n            style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n          />\n        </picture>\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>This graph is mostly inspired by engineers, but it applies to any high skilled labor or someone in R&#x26;D.

And like many, my first year was pretty bad in terms of both social and academic growth. I made very little effort to make new friends, skipped most classes, scored 7 point something CGPA and had no idea what I was going to do in life.</p>\n<p>Although I had prior understanding of programming, my first hands-on keyboard experience was my Data Structures and Algorithms course. Those juicy Sun Microsystems computers and fully air conditioned labs used to put me to sleep after lunch. I was a slow learner in that class. I was started struggling a lot when the time came to implement linked lists or perform string manipulations in character arrays. Segmentation Fault used to be the highlight of most days.</p>\n<p>Somehow, I managed to pass all the exams and started doing all the random things college freshers do in India - soldering thin wires on an iron plate, mistaking flasks for bowls in chemistry labs while wearing thick white coats and shovelling soil. We all have done it all.</p>\n<p>Second semester started and something was missing. Not that long ago, I had cracked IIT JEE, what is supposed to be country's most difficult engineering exam which everyone writes. Millions. And I was top 2000 in the country. Not too bad, eh? And here I was, clueless about life. And it was not just me, others were clueless just like me.</p>\n<p>This is when my <em>bhaiya</em> told me about Open Source and Google Summer of Code. <em>\"Create a GitHub profile and start contributing to previous GSoC projects\"</em> he said. The horrors of implementing a linked list in C were fresh in my mind. I started learning Python. I remember a phone call when I said - <em>\"it just feels like a wrapper which is easy to understand, but isn't this just cheating? I don't understand C. I don't know programming\"</em>. I was doing everything possible to sabotage my self-esteem and tell myself that I'm a failure and can't write code.</p>\n<p>The night GSoC results came out, I changed. It felt like Open Source will resurrect my joy and meaning in life.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>What you have just read involves a lot of luck but also persistence. And still, only 0.01% make it this far with this speed. Think about all the students who didn't get proper coaching to study for IIT JEE. All the students in Tier 2, Tier 3 colleges who thought they can get good jobs just by attending classes and doing well in exams.</p>\n<p>Our country is training students to pass exams and not really to get real world experience or acquire knowledge. This is no surprise, we've known this for a while. However, now I feel nothing will change if we keep ranting and not do anything about it.</p>\n<p>While we're just thinking about all of this, there are \"influencers\" with millions of followers on YouTube and Instagram, telling batshit crazy things to students. With no professional experience, they are preparing an army of next generation of students in India - all driven by fear and fandom. This all came to light with the biggest fuck up in India's EdTech industry - Byju's, which made billions, cashing on the fear, doubt and uncertainty of Indian parents for their kids' education.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Over the course of five years in college, I spent countless hours trying to create more such stories like mine. In my first year, only 4 students were selected for GSoC. In my final year, the count was 32. Many went ahead to create their own projects that summer. In my first year, competitive coding and leetcode were the go-to ways to land a job. In my final year, there were companies taking direct interviews if you had done GSoC or had good Open Source projects in your resume.</p>\n<p>This all happened due to a handful of us trying to teach Open Source, Git, GitHub, Python and most importantly, created an inclusive environment for anyone to be a hacker and take control of their destiny. One of those groups is still active after 10 years of existence, it's called <a href=\"https://kossiitkgp.org/\">Kharagpur Open Source Society</a>.</p>\n<p>Our flagship program <a href=\"https://kwoc.kossiitkgp.org/\">Kharagpur Winter of Code</a> is one of the finest ways to get young IIT students get started with Open Source. In the first year, we had 2500+ registration and 100s created their first meaningful Pull Request ever. I know few of them personally, some are really smart engineers and builders today, while some are pursuing higher education at esteemed institutions in US and Europe. In the following years, many other IITs and colleges started their own \"Winter of Code\" programs. The spark had ignited a fire.</p>\n<p>In recent years, my work has taken me to different fields, with diverse people and cultures. These experiences have only deepened my pride in the unique and valuable communities I had experienced at IIT KGP and KOSS. Yet, I can’t ignore some challenges that persist even today. It's unsettling for me and I spend too much time thinking about it.</p>\n<p>There's so much to discuss and lots to learn. I realized there are many who feel this way and want a place to continue sharing their stories. The whole thing exploded with my latest blog post called <a href=\"/00aec7553fc23e8032bf3b1645be5ac9/why-dont-you-move-abroad.md\">Why Don't You Move Abroad?</a>.</p>\n<p>I invite you all to join me in these conversations.

Strangely enough, the very first time I came to US, it was also as a speaker at a conference.</p>\n<p><em>“Did you just say you are a speaker at this thing?”</em>, asked the US Visa officer, before stamping a B1/B2 on my Passport for ten years.</p>\n<p>I was 18 back then. The confusion made sense.</p>\n<p>A decade has gone by. I got married, switched multiple jobs, wrote a lot of code, lived in three different continents, spoke at many conferences and made a lot of friends for life. I am now back living in India.</p>\n<p><em>“Dude, so when are you moving to the US?”,</em> I frequently get asked by friends, colleagues and my well-wishers.</p>\n<p><em>“I’m not”.</em></p>\n<p>My answer falls flat on most people. It’s as if, I’ve just said, <em>“I do not want more money and success.”</em></p>\n<p>In this blog post I want to add more colors to my answer. Hope some of you relate with this, especially if you are someone like me considering your decision of moving abroad or moving back.</p>\n<p>But first, let me take you back to my teens when life was much simpler and Physics was my most favorite thing in life.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-iit-dream\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-iit-dream\" aria-label=\"the iit dream permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The IIT Dream</h2>\n<p>Just like many Indians of my generation, I spent my childhood in a single bedroom rented house. Every evening, my brother and I would sit in front of a oil lamp (later battery lamp) and study maths and science. In the mornings, our <em>dada ji</em> would teach us English and Hindi grammar. It was a household where two things were most valued - Education and Love.</p>\n<p>Education, because that seemed like the only way to escape generational poverty and not having to worry about, if there are enough candlesticks to last the week or not.</p>\n<p>And, Love because <em>familia is everything</em>.</p>\n<p>Millions of students in India prepare to get into IITs every year. With the proper amount of luck and improper amount of childhood sacrifices, I made it into IIT Kharagpur. And that changed everything.</p>\n<p>During the admission to engineering colleges, more than two thirds of students want to study Computer Science. This is what increases the chances of landing a job and what everyone seems to be doing. In my hostel room in Kota where I studied for 2 years of IIT prep, I had a note stuck on my wall which listed all the opening and closing ranks of all Computer Science branches in the 7 major IITs. When I saw the results and my rank, it was nowhere close to those CS cutoff ranks and I teared up as if I had failed.</p>\n<p>And just like that, 99.99% of Indian students start their education journey by the system telling them that they are not worth it and they don’t even get to decide what they study.</p>\n<p>While I couldn’t get into the Computer Science department, I knew what I wanted to study. My father has been a software engineer since the 90s and my brother is an absolute rockstar with computers. We didn’t have cartoons in TV back in our childhood but had our hands on keyboard ever since I could possibly remember.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bauva.com/blog/be-like-ekalavya/\">So, I was ready to join IIT and say <em>“Fuck you,”</em> to the education system, “<em>I’m going to be the best programmer the world has ever seen.”</em></a></p>\n<h2 id=\"college-and-open-source\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#college-and-open-source\" aria-label=\"college and open source permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>College and Open Source</h2>\n<p>I was nowhere close to being the best programmer. I failed to implement a linked list in C in my first year. It was not going well. However, at the same time, I created my first Python package <a href=\"https://github.com/morse-talk/morse-talk\">morse-talk</a> and published on pypi.org. It was immediately used by a professor somewhere in Europe who forked it and made a lot of contributions.</p>\n<p>My goal of being the “best programmer” shifted to \"create value for others by writing code\". That summer, only 4 students were selected in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code\">Google Summer of Code</a> from my college. I was one of them, the only freshman. Two years of GSoC paid more than enough to cover my five years of college tuition fees. I found both value and meaning by doing Open Source.</p>\n<p>Very quickly, people started referring me with my <a href=\"https://github.com/orkohunter\">GitHub handle</a> OrkoHunter. I, among few of my good friends, established <a href=\"https://kossiitkgp.org/\">Kharagpur Open Source Society</a> to spread the culture of Open Source in campus. Though secretly, it was to give hope to the students who were defeated by the education system and told <em>“You can’t study Computer Science, because you didn’t know Carbon has a radioactive isotope.”</em> In the first few years, we exclusively hired only non-CS students out of spite.</p>\n<h2 id=\"twitter--san-francisco\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#twitter--san-francisco\" aria-label=\"twitter  san francisco permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Twitter @ San Francisco</h2>\n<p>I was having a blast with the altruism that came with organizing Open Source workshops for students, helping them write their first useful Python application and making their first Pull Request. In 2017, we organized our first ever Open Source conference in college. We had about a thousand attendees, two days of talks, tutorials and lots of fun. We had full blown AV setup, speakers and attendees coming from multiple cities. We had a large budget too. I was leading it, being one of the three co-chairs of the conference. We were living the dream!</p>\n<p>One night during the summit, I received an email from a recruiter at Twitter - <em>“Hey Himanshu, We saw your GitHub profile. Would you like to join us for an internship at Twitter San Francisco office in the Open Source team?”</em>. I was so busy with the conference that I forgot to respond for 24 hours. She reached back - <em>“Himanshu, are you interested?”</em></p>\n<p>Landing a foreign internship in college is one of those 0.1% things - it’s extremely rare. You need to practice a lot of leetcode, have excellent referrals and be a sports programmer ready to traverse a binary tree. I have never written a Binary Tree traversal in life.</p>\n<p>My interviews were all around the projects I had open sourced by then. One being the most popular Python library for Graph Theory, the other being a package used to study X-ray data from black holes. I was working on much more important things. Learning how to traverse a Binary Tree for me was a waste of time - that’s how I saw it back then. I knew I will most likely never use it. Though I used to be maniacal about writing reusable code and ReactJS!</p>\n<p>I applied for the J1 visa (short term work visa) and made my way to San Francisco. That summer in SF was probably the coldest summer I had ever. The internship paid extremely well and taught a lot of things about corporate Open Source. I worked upon setting up the <a href=\"https://opensource.twitter.dev\">opensource.twitter.dev</a> - something which still runs and publishes weekly reports of Twitter’s flagship open source projects. I’m pretty sure Elon Musk has seen the website.</p>\n<p>Career-wise, it was the best thing that could have happened to me. My manager from Twitter moved to Spotify later on who told me about the Backstage Open Source project, which led me to Harness leading the product built on top of Backstage. As Steve Jobs once said, <em>“you will only be able to connect the dots looking backwards.”</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-emotional-turmoil-in-san-francisco\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-emotional-turmoil-in-san-francisco\" aria-label=\"the emotional turmoil in san francisco permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The Emotional Turmoil in San Francisco</h2>\n<p>Despite the thrilling career advancements that summer, I often wept myself to sleep at nights. The timezone difference between India and US west coast is about 12 hours. Which means, when you wake up, your family and friends are about to go to bed. And when you come back from office, your family has just woken up. Couple of hours is all you get to connect with anyone back home.</p>\n<p>Okay, here’s the thing, I had lived alone before. For the IIT prep, I was in Kota for 2 years locked in my room and studying, visited home only two times during Diwalis. My college was in a remote village and far from home as well. But I had never felt that lonely, being on the other side of the world than home.</p>\n<p>I am also not an introvert when it comes to talking to strangers. I was leading two student groups in college and fortunately made a lot of friends. It was easy for me to approach seniors, batch mates and juniors in college to build relationships. However, making friends in US was a completely different ballgame.</p>\n<p>Money and Status was on everyone’s mind. All they talked about was Visas, dating, getting paid more and playing a different kind of game that I wanted to play. Not many <em>truly</em> wanted to be a software engineer or cared about Software. While I found few who did and made a real attempt to know each other - the friendships I found in the US were very shallow. Back home, we called them acquaintances.</p>\n<p>It all felt … like an unlivable place for commoners like me. Homelessness was at its peak. I am the guy, who likes to walk slow on the streets without a destination. But I was told on day one Twitter orientation to <em>“Walk fast”</em>. Drugged homeless people approached me, one guy tried to hit me while waiting to cross the street. I once went out to get some groceries and when making a turn, I saw a person holding a gun, hiding at the turn, waiting for someone. I had never seen a gun in my life till that point. It made me think - <em>“If I’m caught accidentally in a gun fight here, no amount of legal justice or candle marches would make my parents happy”.</em></p>\n<p>Don’t get me wrong, I have a huge respect for San Francisco and the Bay Area. For me, it still is one of the most beautiful places on earth. Being an engineer as well as follower of Ram Dass and Timothy Leary, I thank the west for what it has given to world. One of the first Open Source license BSD, came from Berkley. The computer I am using to write this on, came from the valley. Silicon Valley is an absolutely historic place for a techie like me. I actually felt quiet emotional walking on the Haight-Ashbury street. The words “Turn On, Tune In and Drop out” echoed in my ears.</p>\n<p>Despite the respect for the place and culture, I found myself struggling to become one with it. After spending 4 months there, I still had one year of college left. On my final day in US, I ate my last bagel sandwich in a cafe in Mission district and boarded my flight back to Kolkata. After 24 hours of flight and three hours of cab drive, I reached my hostel. One of my dear friends was waiting for me downstairs at 2AM. We hugged and I knew, I had arrived <em>home</em>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"college-placements-and-first-job\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#college-placements-and-first-job\" aria-label=\"college placements and first job permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>College placements and first job</h2>\n<p>Being an Indian student, it is almost impossible to get your first job in the US. Very rarely companies take the chance of picking you to go through H1B lottery, employers go for a safer choice. My manager at Twitter tried to get me a job, but after months of struggle, he gave up, and I had no job offer.</p>\n<p>All IITs and most colleges have a “placement season” where companies fly in on campus and hire as many students as they can within a short period of time. It’s a flea market. Thousands of students show up in collared white shirts, blue pants and polished black shoes with resumes in their hands. Day 1 placement makes you a rockstar among your friends. If you are not placed by Day 10, you are essentially a loser.</p>\n<p>Students get no choice of where they want to work at. If you pass their series of coding tests, panel discussions and what not - you are given one offer (if you are blessed then maybe 2-3 offers) and have to make the decision in an hour. No negotiation on what you will be doing, at what location or at what compensation.</p>\n<p>The rebel in me found the system to be dehumanizing, especially for the Top 1% students of the country. As a result, I told myself that I will find a job elsewhere where I will have some idea on what I’ll be working upon and with whom. I did not sign up for campus placements.</p>\n<p>A friend of mine connected me with an employer in Tokyo. The product was Mercari US and the team was pretty diverse. It paid well and many of my friends were already going to Tokyo that year. I interviewed with the CTO, VP of Product and Engineering and my Engineering Manager, and I was in! Again, without traversing a binary tree. The job paid extremely well for a new grad like me. I was set to join them after I graduate. As they say, <em>when it rains, it pours</em>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"life-in-tokyo\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#life-in-tokyo\" aria-label=\"life in tokyo permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Life in Tokyo</h2>\n<p>I was very excited to go to Japan. I found the country to be extremely calm and connected with the roots of human consciousness. It was people, people were hardworking but respectful of each other. Great customer service, free of crime and welcoming. Everyone was somehow aware. Everyone respected elderly and valued wisdom.</p>\n<p>Japan and India only has a timezone difference of about 4 hours. There was plenty of time in the day for me to connect back to family and friends. I made friends there as well, actually a lot of them. I was sharing my apartment with a very good friend of mine from college. Life was amazing!</p>\n<p>Work was great too. I distinctly remember my manager saying - <em>“You don’t seem like a fresher”</em>. All because I have been writing real code for 5 years at that point and not traversing binary trees. I knew what a 12 factor app was and how to write effective Database queries that scales up to tens of thousands of daily active users.</p>\n<p>One fine day, I was talking to my ex-manager back from Twitter, who had just moved to Spotify. He told me about <a href=\"https://github.com/backstage/backstage\">Backstage Open Source</a>. It was released just a few days ago, on March 14, 2020. I have always dreamt about writing Open Source software while getting paid for it. He said, <em>“Himanshu, just so you know, I would love to work with you again in a heartbeat, if I could.”</em></p>\n<p>Over the weekend, I got two pull requests merged in the project. It had 50 GitHub stars back then and a few contributors. It is currently at about 30K stars with 1500+ contributors. Interviews happened with Spotify and I knew every single one of my interviewers. In one of those, we forgot to introduce ourselves as we have been talking back and forth on Discord on the same day. I made my way in. Spotify flew me Premium Economy to Stockholm, the land of Opeth and Zlatan Ibrahimovic. That’s all I knew about Sweden.</p>\n<h2 id=\"life-in-stockholm-and-covid\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#life-in-stockholm-and-covid\" aria-label=\"life in stockholm and covid permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Life in Stockholm and Covid</h2>\n<p>My first summer in Stockholm was my best summer ever. The bar was already high by that point, but I absolutely enjoyed biking every weekend to play football, walking around the rivers, parks and nearby jungles. Stockholm is an interesting landscape, within 5 mins you can reach downtown, a river, a historic place or a cave - it’s all nearby, everything is.</p>\n<p>Europe values work-life balance like no one else. I still believe if anyone wants to have fun in life and doesn't want to work too hard, get a job in Europe.</p>\n<p>But back then, Covid was at its peak. It didn’t affect my life in Sweden who was one of the few countries to not implement ban on anything. However, I didn’t get to see enough of Europe or attended enough concerts as I had hoped for. I only got to travel in my last year, and it was already too late - the dark winters in Stockholm had taken a hit on me.</p>\n<p>Two and half years passed by. I experienced the peak of my career. Got to be known as “The Backstage Guy” in the Open Source community. I saw the team grew from 10 to 50 and onboarded many engineers, many of them were far more skilled and experienced than me. I had learned a lot at Spotify and is one of the best companies to be working for as an engineer.</p>\n<p>The timezone difference was not that different either. Again 4 hours and I was able to connect with my family and friends. I found some good friends back there as well. However, during that time, my grandmother passed away. This was the first time I had experienced death in my family. Someone I knew was no more in this world. I was not able to go back in time and mourn with family. Though I was not extremely attached to my grandma, it made me think - <em>what if I had lost someone else, someone far closer to me?</em> It was also the time when I became a lot closer to my lovely childhood friend, who is now my wife. After many years, it made no sense to me to live far from her.</p>\n<p>In all the European and work life glory, something was not working out.</p>\n<h2 id=\"you-know-you-can-come-back-right\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#you-know-you-can-come-back-right\" aria-label=\"you know you can come back right permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a><em>“You know you can come back right?”</em></h2>\n<p>One fine day, I was sitting in my living room. I had gained about 25 KGs of additional weight in the past year. It was three in the afternoon and the sun had already set. I was on a video call with my dad. We were talking about a few things, one of them being Russia’s invasion on Ukraine. He was quiet worried about the situations in Europe. I said Sweden had no bone in this fight so don’t worry about it. But then after the conversation, he was about to hang up, as mom had called for the evening tea. Just then, something hit me and I froze. <em>I was alone in this apartment, middle of nowhere. Why was I not there with them, having that cup of tea?</em></p>\n<p>I broke. Tears streamed down my face and I had no words. What could I have said? That I am an incapable, grown man who can’t even live on his own? Someone who can’t move on from family? At that moment, I just wanted to hug my father, but I couldn’t.</p>\n<p>He kept asking - <em>What happened? Why are you crying? Are you not well?</em></p>\n<p>Silence. I had no words to explain what I was feeling. It was definitely the <em>Chai</em>, now that I think about it. Us Indians, huh.</p>\n<p>After few minutes, he said something that unlocked a door in my perception that I had never opened. He said, <em>“You know you can always come back right? No one is forcing you to live there. You can have an amazing life back in India too.”</em></p>\n<p>To be honest, I didn’t know this. I really did not know this! All I knew, was that you are supposed to move abroad when you grow up. Moving abroad is synonymous with being successful, filling up your bank account. It takes your career to the moon and gives you the highest level of status possible among your peers. I thought that was the only, most respectful way.</p>\n<p>The very next day, I wrote an email to my General Manager that I am moving to India. Spotify didn’t permit engineers to work from India, so I knew this was not going to work out. But at that moment, I just wanted to go back home and hug my father - and no job or salary was going to stop me from doing that.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, Spotify valued the work I was doing with Backstage and exceptionally permitted me to work from India. I was their first R&#x26;D hire here.</p>\n<h2 id=\"back-home\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#back-home\" aria-label=\"back home permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Back home</h2>\n<p>Once I had made the decision to move, I decided to update my friends about it. I put up a WhatsApp status and also made a post on LinkedIn. <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6944645250938241024/\">My post went viral</a> with 5 million views, 28,000 reactions and 900 comments.</p>\n<p>My decision to move back was shocking to many. Many of my friends who lived abroad related to the challenges of loneliness and cultural shock with me. It was also post-Covid era, where many realized remote work is possible and being in the same location all the time is not needed. Startups were blooming, many of them hiring engineering exclusively in India. There was a mass reverse-brain drain happening in that moment, it still is happening, and I am very excited about it!</p>\n<p>I moved back home, starting living in Mumbai with my wife and family. I now get to spend time with my parents without having to plan my days and think about my international travels. Back then, any travel would be 2-4 weeks and there was no room to catchup with an old friend in a different city. I had missed so many reunions, marriages and family events. I now attend them all.</p>\n<p>My mental health has now fully recovered. My physical health is coming along, long way to go still.</p>\n<p>I work remotely at Harness as a Product Manager, the best job I could be doing right now. I fly to Bangalore every quarter to meet my team in person and spend a lot of time with my colleagues in the US over Zoom. I like working late, my most productive hours are 6-10PM. In childhood, this was the time after school where I would sit to study without any distractions. In college, this was the time after classes for club meetups, project discussions or just writing code. Even at work, my most important meetings happen in the evening. Some see it as a cost of living in India, for me this works just fine. Maybe things will change after having kids.</p>\n<h2 id=\"so-why-dont-you-move-abroad-now\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#so-why-dont-you-move-abroad-now\" aria-label=\"so why dont you move abroad now permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>So, why don’t you move abroad now?</h2>\n<p>I think people should live where they are the happiest. Happiness sparks creativity and is responsible for overall success. Yes, moving to US increases my chances of professional career success, I’ll get to be in proximity with people who have ideas and money to make the ideas come alive. But for me, it comes with significant emotional damage. For some people out there, this is a sacrifice worth making. This was a lot true 20 years ago. The internet age has changed everything. It is now possible to balance career, wealth and happiness while living in India as a techie.</p>\n<p><em>“Why don’t you move to the US with your wife? You’ll have family and friends around.”</em></p>\n<p>Let me put it in a way which doesn’t offend people - very few of my friends in the US are my real friends. My best friends in US are all planning to move back. My other friends are stuck in the whirlwind of H1Bs and Green Card applications and coping up with their emotional challenges. I wish the best for all of them, but I do not enjoy that lifestyle - it reeks of captivity and not freedom.</p>\n<p><em>“If you plan to start your own company, shouldn’t you move out of India?”</em></p>\n<p>Yes I do intend to create a company in the future. And yes, most likely the customers are going to be in the west. However, I have seen enough companies with India based founders that I have full confidence I do not have to move personally to make the company successful.

Visas make it extremely hard for Indians to start a company in the US. The whole process makes me want to puke. The Government and popular opinion seems to be heading in an opposite direction. The dehumanizing experience is similar to my take on campus placements in college above.</p>\n<p><em>“Why don’t you move temporarily for a few years?”</em></p>\n<p>Maybe for 3 months, yes. Moving for 2 years is a slippery slope of accepting the emotional damage which I will cause to myself and my wife. The drug called monthly salary will keep adding band-aids to the damage and it will again be too late before I realize the repercussions.</p>\n<p><em>“If you don’t move, it will affect your career.”</em></p>\n<p>For me, success is both the professional success and emotional wellbeing. I am willing to sacrifice some of my professional success for the other.

I uplifted many and showed alternate ways to do well in life. At least, for a few dozen people. A path which did not include Grades and meaningless competitive code grinding.</p>\n<p>I think 21st century is a fantastic time to be in a developing nation like India, especially among the tech-enabled hard-working Indians that I know of. I have a lot of hope for my generation. I plan to write more on this in a separate post, when I find time.</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoyed reading through this. If at any point, I have hurt your sentiments, I would like to apologize. This is me expressing my own personal views on this very controversial and emotional topic. I still advise people to choose what’s best for them, moving abroad is a great option for many who do not carry emotional baggage like me. We all have one life, and we all should do what’s best for us and our loved ones.

It was a visionary yet strong idea to force all the internal services to communicate with each other via APIs. They were to assume that all services can be externalized in near future.

This platform equips developers with the resources they need to build, test, deploy, and manage applications efficiently, while abstracting away much of the underlying infrastructure complexity.</p>\n<p>By providing a standardized environment, automation capabilities, and reusable components, platform engineering empowers developers to focus on coding and business logic rather than grappling with deployment intricacies or operational concerns.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whats-next\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#whats-next\" aria-label=\"whats next permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>What's next?</h2>\n<p>Further in this series, I will explore</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A brief history of Backstage, another CNCF project among the ranks of Kubernetes and cloud native technologies.</li>\n<li>What is an \"Internal Developer Portal\" and how it is the backbone of any platform org in a company.</li>\n<li>Current state of developer portals and the use-cases</li>\n<li>Future of Platform engineering</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Join me in discussing this revolutionary phase of elevating Developer Experience!</p>","timeToRead":3}},{"node":{"id":"35f22f0a-2485-5bfb-b011-7042d7a2ae17","frontmatter":{"categories":["Tech"],"date":"Oct 2022","draft":false,"slug":"/blog/backstage-internal-developer-portal","subtitle":"A note on why Backstage's plugin architecture makes it the best platform for building Internal Developer Portals","summary":"A note on why Backstage's plugin architecture makes it the best platform for building Internal Developer Portals","title":"Your product either lives long enough to become a platform or it dies out"},"html":"<p><figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative;

It needs to have a way of writing extensions/plugins/apps to extend the product.</p>\n<p>And that is true for almost all of the softwares we use. It’s true if you really think about it. Think of all the things developers use today.</p>\n<p>Let’s start with more common examples. Smartphones and Computers. There were some good phones in 2007 but iPhone came and disrupted the market. What was so unique about it? It introduced the possibility of \"writing apps for phones\". And anyone could write them. We now have several billion dollar companies which are technically just apps.</p>\n<p>If iPhone was a batteries included phone, with Apple responsible for creating all the modern apps people use, we wouldn’t be here today. Same goes for all operating systems like Linux, macOS and Windows. They are all platforms.</p>\n<p>What’s the next big thing a developer uses? Probably a browser. Even there, you can build chrome extensions, firefox plugins and what not.</p>\n<p>Not to forget some of the most popular websites in the world like youtube, facebook, amazon, twitter, spotify, etc. are conventionally platforms.</p>\n<p>What's next on a developer's minds? GitHub, Gitlab, etc. to host source code? You can build apps and integrations on them. It has it's own marketplace.</p>\n<p>You use VSCode, vim, emacs etc. to write code? People have been building plugins for them for more than 30 years. They have a marketplace too.</p>\n<p>Do you use Slack to communicate? You can build integrations and apps that run on Slack.</p>\n<p>iTerm2 as terminal? zsh as shell? Plugins, plugins, plugins everywhere!</p>\n<p><figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 735px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/cf2e5f163fad4cc35dea765394af52a5/64a54/plugins-everywhere.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 68%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n          <source\n              srcset=\"/static/cf2e5f163fad4cc35dea765394af52a5/529ab/plugins-everywhere.webp 625w,\n/static/cf2e5f163fad4cc35dea765394af52a5/c4c4c/plugins-everywhere.webp 735w\"\n              sizes=\"(max-width: 735px) 100vw, 735px\"\n              type=\"image/webp\"\n            />\n          <source\n            srcset=\"/static/cf2e5f163fad4cc35dea765394af52a5/0f1e4/plugins-everywhere.jpg 625w,\n/static/cf2e5f163fad4cc35dea765394af52a5/64a54/plugins-everywhere.jpg 735w\"\n            sizes=\"(max-width: 735px) 100vw, 735px\"\n            type=\"image/jpeg\"\n          />\n          <img\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n            src=\"/static/cf2e5f163fad4cc35dea765394af52a5/64a54/plugins-everywhere.jpg\"\n            alt=\"Plugins everywhere meme\"\n            title=\"Plugins everywhere meme\"\n            loading=\"lazy\"\n            decoding=\"async\"\n            style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n          />\n        </picture>\n  </a>\n    </span>\n    <figcaption class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figcaption\">Plugins everywhere meme</figcaption>\n  </figure></p>\n<p>If you analyze your entire tech stack, you will be surprised how many of them support writing plugins. From your database to your CI provider. From Kubernetes to Docker. From Figma to a Raspberry pi.</p>\n<p>And if any of these products are open source, you can do more than just extending them. You can technically change them from their very core.</p>\n<p>But why is that? Why did iPhones kicked the Motorola-s out of the market? Why would someone prefer a platform where they have to do extra work themselves over choosing an all-inclusive but closed product? The answer varies subjectively with people. To me, it’s the power that comes with open collaboration. You get more people building great things and sharing with each other, beyond the boundaries of a company or an org. Luckily open source has taught us similar lessons in the past 30 years.</p>\n<p>To sum it up, there is no one-size-fits-all solution for developers. They love the unique culture in their teams and cherish them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-do-developers-prefer-backstage-over-other-idp-platforms\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#why-do-developers-prefer-backstage-over-other-idp-platforms\" aria-label=\"why do developers prefer backstage over other idp platforms permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Why do developers prefer Backstage over other IDP platforms?</h2>\n<p>If you don’t already know about <a href=\"https://backstage.io\">Backstage</a>, it’s an open platform for building developer portals in your company. It’s an open source project incubating at CNCF.</p>\n<p>An <a href=\"https://internaldeveloperplatform.org/what-is-an-internal-developer-platform/#developer-portal-service-catalog-ui-api-or-cli\">internal developer portal</a> is something that looks different at each company and has different use-cases. For some, it’s the developer's go-to hub for anything and everything. For some, it’s their entire catalog of the internal software ecosystem. For some, it’s their place to read and explore technical documentation. Or a place to launch new software components in the company. And many, many more such use cases.</p>\n<p>Spotify has over 200 plugins inside their Backstage instance to enable additional use cases like A/B testing, user management, inner source, data pipelines, monitoring, deployment tracker and so on.</p>\n<p>All these Backstage plugins inside a company are not built by their core maintainers team - it is federated and built by the experts in their domain.

Aldous Huxley wrote a dystopian classic called Brave New World, which is contemporary to 1984 and has a similar literary significance.

We perceive things around us uniquely. For example, it doesn't matter how close we feel to a person, let it be our partner, a close friend of ours or our parents - each of our perceptions will always be different. And it gets interesting if you think more about it.</p>\n<p>\"We live together, we act on, and react to, one another; but always and in all circumstances we are\nby ourselves. The martyrs go hand in hand into the arena; they are crucified alone. Embraced, the lovers desperately try to fuse their insulated ecstasies into a single self-transcendence; in vain. By its very nature every embodied spirit is doomed to suffer and enjoy in solitude. Sensations, feelings, insights, fancies - all these are private and, except through symbols and at second hand, incommunicable. We can pool information about experiences, but never the experiences themselves. From family to nation, every human group is a society of island universes...\", says Huxley in this book.</p>\n<h2 id=\"reality\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#reality\" aria-label=\"reality permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Reality</h2>\n<p>If someone asks me - what do you mean by reality? I'll say, well, you know the trees grow, flowers bloom, we live on planet Earth, which is round, human beings experience pain and suffering, gravity exists - and the other things that I see in the world.</p>\n<p>In my answer, I only mentioned what is easy for me to say, and can be agreed upon by a lot of people - hopefully everyone. But my complete reality is much larger and has edges which get a bit fuzzier. And I have not grown enough to describe them well, I think.

He basically suggests that we'll never know the <em>absolute reality</em> even if it exists. The tool that helps us cut this \"slice\" is called Perception.</p>\n<p>But the good news is that our perceptions change, or rather expand.

Their doors are locked for us. For example, if you never given birth, you can still talk about parenting but there is so much more still locked for you. And you'll get to unlock that <em>door</em> only when you will raise a child.</p>\n<p>He says that we are caged inside our perceptions, and that there are doors which lead us to new realities. But so far we have opened only a handful of them. And majority of doors are still locked for us - and that too from outside - so it's not possible for us to go and see what's on the other side merely by <em>thinking</em>.</p>\n<p>It takes experiences - or rather \"meaningful experiences\" to unlock these doors.</p>\n<h2 id=\"communication\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#communication\" aria-label=\"communication permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Communication</h2>\n<p>My university campus was beautiful. The trees and the shades of green always blew my mind. Taking frequent walks in the day was one of my favorite activities. For a few years, I thought everyone around me knew it - just because it was obvious for me.</p>\n<p>After reading Huxley and The Doors of Perception, I entered a brief but gloomy phase in life. He basically gave me some uncomfortable realizations that I had to live with. No matter how much I love my parents or my partner, they will never get to know it all. A part of me was getting sadder with more experiences I was having one by one. And it was getting harder for me to communicate <em>everything</em> I felt. I was naive.</p>\n<p>Years have passed and I have made peace with this limitation of life. We can not communicate everything, but we can try! Since then, I started putting more effort into the ways I communicate. Sometimes I speak, write poems, draw analogies from stories - and sometimes I would just send someone a song. I have made peace with the fact that everything can not be conveyed with language. Some things need to be heard, seen and felt.</p>\n<p>Same goes for taking pictures. Don't get me wrong - I think photos are a great way of communicating. But sometimes I respect a view, by not taking a picture. How would you feel if someone took a favorite song of yours, and sang it poorly and offbeat? The same goes for me when I try to capture extraordinary beauty of nature in pixels. It usually happens with mountains, forests, oceans, etc.</p>\n<h2 id=\"art-is-an-attempt-to-communicate\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#art-is-an-attempt-to-communicate\" aria-label=\"art is an attempt to communicate permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Art is an attempt to communicate</h2>\n<p>Art (poetry, music, paintings etc.) are beautiful attempts by human beings to convey their perceptions.

In a healthy open source community, maintainers spend a big chunk of their time reviewing incoming Pull Requests. There are many times when review comments leave me in awe - and I am filled with gratitude. The reviewer wants to have good quality code in the software, but in effect of that, you learn so much more from their insights and experience.</p>\n<p>Ideally, this is one of the those experiences you may get in your internships and first few jobs. But what are the chances of you ending up in such a team? And even if you get one helpful mentor, that's just one. If you stay in Open Source communities, you are constantly learning from numerous of those, and not just in summer for a period of three months.</p>\n<p>Our ways of doing software are heavily biased on the first projects we get involved with. We copy over the ideas to the future, since we know they have worked well. Exposure to multiple Open Source projects break that bias, and exposes us to other newer ways of creating Software.</p>\n<p>I have seen many issues on GitHub describing a problem that seems extremely hard to solve. And when GitHub says, <em>this issue got closed by this specific Pull Request</em> - I feel spoiled that I get to see what that Pull Request did. To have public access to such knowledge is a gift to this community.</p>\n<p>Not everyone studies Computer Science in college. And even if they do, their Software Engineering courses are either missing or outdated to the current day and age. MIT launched a course called - <a href=\"https://missing.csail.mit.edu/\">\"The Missing Semester of Your CS Education\"</a> to address this problem. Computer Science and Software Engineering have grown so much now, that it's impossible to teach both of them in a single curriculum. And the subjects have diverged - It has become Theory vs Practicality, Research vs Industry. Not all but most CS Professors are much closer to the research than the industry, and they expect students to do Open Source projects and internships on their own to gain the industry experience.</p>\n<p>Last but not least, a vast majority of Open Source work is done remote, over the internet, with strangers. The skills required to carry on a remote work become fundamental necessities - good written communication is one of many.</p>\n<h2 id=\"you-escape-the-privilege-barrier\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#you-escape-the-privilege-barrier\" aria-label=\"you escape the privilege barrier permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>You escape the privilege barrier</h2>\n<p>In India, more than a million students graduate engineering courses <em>every year</em>.

In my program I was doing an API request. Irrespective of whether the request was successful, my variable to store the API response was always <code class=\"language-text\">undefined</code>. I was in my first year of college and I expressed my frustration to my brother with <em>\"Javascript sucks\"</em>. All he said was <em>\"Remember, Javascript is asynchronous.\"</em> And that fixed the issue! I still see such problems and they get fixed by the <em>Remember...</em></p>\n<p>Most of the beginners face this problem with Javascript in their early days because Javascript is async in nature.

The I/O (Input/Output) operation for a computer is to talk to other computers. The I/O operation for us is to talk to other people.</p>\n<p>This blocks the main program. It means there is a chunk of time that it takes away from the main program for as long as the blocking execution is being done.</p>\n<p>These I/O operations are necessary for us to survive and communicate. They happen frequently and are also time-consuming. It then becomes important for us to manage them well.</p>\n<p><strong>Living Asynchronously is us making sure our I/O operations are asynchronous most of the time.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"applying-the-philosophy\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#applying-the-philosophy\" aria-label=\"applying the philosophy permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Applying the philosophy</h2>\n<h3 id=\"year-2004-age-7\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#year-2004-age-7\" aria-label=\"year 2004 age 7 permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Year 2004 Age 7</h3>\n<p>I remember in my school, our Maths textbooks used to have many questions in the form of exercises. An exercise was a collection of questions on one topic. There used to be dozens of chapters and hundreds of exercises in a book. The year-long school curriculum and timeline were to make sure all the chapters and their exercises get completed by the students.</p>\n<p>Generally, the entire batch of students is synchronised on what exercise they are doing. Let's say the teacher decides that this week, we are going to complete the Exercise 21 based on the basic Trigonometric formulae. By Monday next week, It is expected of the students to have their notebooks up-to-date. That's how synchronous programming works.</p>\n<p>This model is not great. Not everyone in the class needs to follow the pace set by the teacher for what they deem is suitable for the class.</p>\n<p>When I was in the 3rd standard (age 7), my father started teaching Maths to my elder brother and me. (Fun fact: All three of us now do programming for a living!). It was 2004. In the summer before the school would begin, dad had set the target for me to solve all the problems in the book I was going to study that year. I loved the experience! Although it took a lot of time from my summer vacation, it was rewarding. And I didn't want to stop there. Dad noticed this and bought me the maths textbooks for the following years. And this went on until in the 7th standard, I was doing the problems of the Maths book used in the 10th class.</p>\n<p>If I had followed the synchronous philosophy of the school, I would have to sit around throughout the year, learning not much new. A decade after that time, I would consciously start living asynchronously.</p>\n<h3 id=\"working-in-college-societies\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#working-in-college-societies\" aria-label=\"working in college societies permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Working in college societies</h3>\n<p>Back in college, for five years I was part of a <a href=\"https://wiki.metakgp.org/w/Technology_Literary_Society\">literary society</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kossiitkgp\">a club</a> to promote open source. These were two separate groups and I was an active member of both! In my 3rd/4th year, I was part of the so called \"executive batch\". We were 4-5 people responsible to execute the events organized by 30-50 of us members, for the hundreds of students on campus to attend.</p>\n<p>Before we organized any event (a poetry night, an open mic, a Python or a GSoC workshop, etc.), I as the organizer needed to sync with all the members helping out. There are many operations that need to be taken care of, like logistics, publicity, poster distribution, members' performances/talks, communication with external members, finances, etc. If I remember correctly, I had burnt out early in the year. I had to sync with so many people during the days of the actual event. I valued the event's success not much by its attendance, but a lot by how we did it and the things we learned in the process.</p>\n<p>Lets take the task of poster distribution. The job was to print a bunch of posters for the event that had its details, description, contact, venue, time, etc. and paste it across the college campus so that other students would notice. From the team, I would assign one person to take care of this. This meant that they were responsible for going to the printing press, getting the copies done, and then with the help of other members, putting them up across the campus. Given I had other equally important tasks to take care of, it was a nightmare to contact all the people involved in this particular task. But, I couldn't just \"assign and forget\" the task to someone because, if he or she decided to slack off, it would disrupt the event. This has happened quite many times as I remember. So, I started identifying people I could trust, who shared the passion of the work and cared. And then, living asynchronously was easy and the only sane way to go about it.</p>\n<p><em>Then on, all my instructions and tasks had their <em>callbacks</em>. And if someone else asked me to do something, I would ask them to write their <em>callback</em> i.e. tell me what to do when I'm done with this. I reduced many unnecessary \"blocking\" I/O operations from my life, resulting in a much relaxed life.</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"whatsapp-message-seen-tick\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#whatsapp-message-seen-tick\" aria-label=\"whatsapp message seen tick permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>WhatsApp message \"seen\" tick</h3>\n<p>Many years ago Facebook started showing things like \"message seen at 10:10 AM\" in their chatbox. This was the first time I saw something like this. Earlier, messaging someone was much like sending a very short email - you didn't expect a response within a minute. Instant communication started catching up and now there is a product called \"mail tracker\" which tells you when and how many times your email was read.</p>\n<p>I have disabled the blue seen tick in WhatsApp and I have a <a href=\"/blog/delete-facebook/\">dummy facebook account</a>. This means, I don't get to know when my message was read and the other person doesn't know when I read their message. This is me, trying to reduce \"synchronous\" communication from life, as it introduces more problems than it solves.</p>\n<p>If someone <em>sees</em> my message, I never ought to expect an instant response. I have no idea what they are doing in their \"main program\". They could be in a thought process, talking with someone else, working on something, or be in one of a thousand different possibilities. So \"seen at 10:10 AM\" gives me no information. It instead triggers me to think - <em>why have they not replied yet</em>.</p>\n<p>If I want to have a synchronous conversation, I would set up a call at the convenience of both of us. That is much efficient in every aspect. By not having to worry about replying instantly and not expecting someone to do so, I have freed a lot of time that I used to waste in waiting for the response.</p>\n<h3 id=\"relationships-and-behaviour\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#relationships-and-behaviour\" aria-label=\"relationships and behaviour permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Relationships and Behaviour</h3>\n<p>If I have the freedom of my thoughts, asynchrony is associated with freedom.</p>\n<p>If our actions and words demand synchronous response from the other person, it directly impacts their time. It affects how they want to spend it. Doing it way often is not nice. And it is a kind gesture to respect their time and do less synchronous communication. Allowing someone to be free is a great expression of love and it makes us better humans.</p>\n<p>I would be crazy to say that all synchronous communications are bad. That would be insane. What I do is reduce the frequency, and increase the time to generate more value. And of course, do lots of async stuff. :)</p>\n<h3 id=\"blog-post-vs-notifications\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#blog-post-vs-notifications\" aria-label=\"blog post vs notifications permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Blog post vs Notifications</h3>\n<p>A blog post is a shining example of communicating asynchronously in this world.</p>\n<p>This blog post does not demand anything from you. You can close it as soon as you opened it, read it now, a week later or next year. I have no expectation of knowing whether you read it or not, unless you want to let me know. I enjoy writing and reading them. They do not feel \"instant\". They do not say \"just now\" or \"posted a minute ago\". As Quincy Larson says - all notifications are synchronous. Social media wants to notify me if someone has said something publicly. Facebook/Instagram/Twitter wants to keep me in \"sync\" with what all my friends are doing.

When I started working, I had the challenge of adopting the same philosophy at work. I knew it would be challenging because people have their own style of working. But I tried my best to keep this philosophy alive with me.</p>\n<p>If I would have technical queries to ask, most of them would be Email or Slack and few in-person. As I understood the team and the technologies better over time, I would change all my questions to being asynchronous. That kept everyone involved a bit happier. The person who'd write the answer, would do so in their free time. Hence the responses had more details and helped me more than what a disrupting synchronous question would have done.</p>\n<p>When a project is newborn, synchronous communication between the stakeholders and engineers is necessary and valuable. They help avoid confusion and misunderstandings. But as the tasks start being granular, sync-meetings begin losing their value.</p>\n<p>If a project has grown large and has no documentation, there is no way asynchronous communication is possible even after months or years. The few people who created it, are going to waste more time answering questions, which they should have written in the form of documentation ages ago.</p>\n<p>Generally, product managers love to talk about projects in team meetings. Why won't they? They have a vision and want to share. But a wise engineering manager would come and ask, \"Can this information be shared via an email?\". This is a smart question to ask each time because it not only promotes written documentation but saves time for the involved engineers. They got time to focus and pay more attention to the work, which would have been disrupted by a synchronous meeting.</p>\n<p>Similar to blog posts, Documentation of projects and code is a light beam of hope in the asynchronous life. If I can find the documentation to read, it drastically reduces the amount of synchronous communication involved to solve my problem. And since a tap on the shoulder in not possible when working remotely, more written communication is the way to go!</p>\n<h3 id=\"tldr-too-long-didnt-read\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#tldr-too-long-didnt-read\" aria-label=\"tldr too long didnt read permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>TLDR (Too long, didn't read)</h3>\n<p>Living Asynchronously is inspired by the concept of asynchronous programming and Javascript's callbacks and promises. Synchronous life events are blocking in nature, are inefficient and time-consuming. It is not always possible, but living asynchronous life has its benefits and is a great way to live.</p>\n<p>I believe this philosophy is easy to understand and can be applied on many aspects of life. I encourage you to think on your own and identify the synchronous events in life. And then imagine how living asynchronously would feel.</p>","timeToRead":10}},{"node":{"id":"f9b08919-1926-5365-ba16-9756ddfdad25","frontmatter":{"categories":["Tech"],"date":"May 2020","draft":false,"slug":"/blog/spotify","subtitle":"Thoughts on Japan, my principles of work and what lies ahead.","summary":"I have written about living in Japan, my work principles and what lies ahead.","title":"Joining Spotify in Sweden"},"html":"<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 2362px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 29.92%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAGCAYAAADDl76dAAAACXBIWXMAAC4jAAAuIwF4pT92AAAA0UlEQVQY033Qv0qCYRgF8F/SUFOjNPfnEgQHFwdrK3CKLiArhELBRYUIvAOhlpAgUCK6Abemlpps6BaaShCiofjwKRy+PNPDc95znvMepmjhA1+4wrJ0ZPyPP+4II/RxhzdcBldAMUW8gA3ksIu1WfIJXVRQwyme49EFjnEQ+0R8iAZuIswjTrCFfGL4giGaaGOAMVaxh3vchuFDHOhFiA7OQpdUtZgYVvGNd7ziE9eRvoQdnGMf2Tiyju2oZBN1lGe/3YjuJtHfUkpn87DyO/0A/AEoMwETdC4AAAAASUVORK5CYII='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n          <source\n              srcset=\"/static/c97391051b6b4cbe34d7a1bfe040d88d/529ab/spotify.webp 625w,\n/static/c97391051b6b4cbe34d7a1bfe040d88d/74e35/spotify.webp 1250w,\n/static/c97391051b6b4cbe34d7a1bfe040d88d/5d4cc/spotify.webp 2362w\"\n              sizes=\"(max-width: 2362px) 100vw, 2362px\"\n              type=\"image/webp\"\n            />\n          <source\n            srcset=\"/static/c97391051b6b4cbe34d7a1bfe040d88d/b1b4f/spotify.png 625w,\n/static/c97391051b6b4cbe34d7a1bfe040d88d/161f7/spotify.png 1250w,\n/static/c97391051b6b4cbe34d7a1bfe040d88d/e1cb3/spotify.png 2362w\"\n            sizes=\"(max-width: 2362px) 100vw, 2362px\"\n            type=\"image/png\"\n          />\n          <img\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n            src=\"/static/c97391051b6b4cbe34d7a1bfe040d88d/e1cb3/spotify.png\"\n            alt=\"spotify\"\n            title=\"spotify\"\n            loading=\"lazy\"\n            decoding=\"async\"\n            style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n          />\n        </picture>\n    </span>\n<a href=\"https://newsroom.spotify.com/media-kit/logo-and-brand-assets/\"><em>Image source</em></a></p>\n<h2 id=\"life-in-japan\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#life-in-japan\" aria-label=\"life in japan permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Life in Japan</h2>\n<p>All the things that I knew about Japan turned out to be true, as soon as I arrived here 8 months ago.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Japan is a <strong>beautiful</strong> place to live! The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry_blossom\">cherry blossoms</a> season just started. There is a lot of nature surrounding downtown Tokyo. I haven't experienced the peak of summer here yet, but the cold climate has been cherry on top of it all.</p>\n<p>I spent five years in my college campus where you could spot trees from anywhere (my hostel room, classrooms and the roads). Having all this nature around me once again was a relief.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Most <strong>people are mindful, quiet and private</strong>. This is great for those who want to live a private life. I believe my friends and I used to be the only ones talking in the entire freaking train.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Delicacies</strong>! I don't remember having a bad meal ever. The proportion size and the amount of calories are thoughtfully decided. The meals are prioritized to be healthy <em>and</em> tasty. This is not true for many countries.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Japan is very <strong>safe</strong>. I know many of my friends never locked their apartments before going out (bad idea). Walking outside late at nights does not feel threatening. I am raised to be careful about incoming traffic and being stoic about what could go wrong. Certainly, I have never had any bad experience. I didn't encounter any homeless people either.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The city is mostly clean. People do not enter anyone's house with their shoes on. There is almost zero vandalism.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <strong>customer service</strong> can not be imagined and replicated easily in other societies of the world. I know and have heard that people in India are very helpful. I felt people in Japan sometimes do <em>beyond normal</em> things for their customers. People take their jobs very seriously. The entire bank staff greets you when you come in. You will not be left unattended even for a minute. And everyone will say Thank you and keep bowing until you get out of the door and disappear. My God, I used to feel bad.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The not-so-good things that I had heard are also true!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Language barrier</p>\n<p>You can get by in Tokyo if you don't know Japanese and have friends whom you can talk to. But my life was of a <em>tourist</em> and was limited in social terms. Essential shopping (groceries, etc.) becomes limited. I have to show an image and hope that the person can recognize what I am asking for. Using a public service e.g. Hospitals, courier service is hard. I can not enquire what I want to. Google Translate is barely helpful, and is useless most of the times.</p>\n<p>Many people learn Japanese after coming here. They see a life here and want to settle. As of now, I know I only want to <em>settle</em> in India and maybe in an English speaking country. My work required no Japanese, hence I did not learn. Instead I invested my time in learning new paradigms of programming in a large company. I feel I made the right decision and learnt a lot.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Rush hour traffic</p>\n<p>You need courage to commute in the morning. Even if I wanted to start my day early, it is not going to happen. Trains are packed at more than 200% of their capacity between 7-9 AM. I won't need to hold any bars in the moving trains because maybe five people would be pushing me from all directions. Lo and behold the laws of physics, I won't fall or even move when the train accelerated. xD</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"principles-of-work\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#principles-of-work\" aria-label=\"principles of work permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Principles of work</h2>\n<p><em>Things I learnt in my first job</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"living-asynchronously\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#living-asynchronously\" aria-label=\"living asynchronously permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Living asynchronously</h3>\n<p>Three years ago, I read this blog post by Quincy Larson, the founder of freecodecamp.org, titled <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/live-asynchronously-c8e7172fe7ea/\">Live asynchronously.</a>. I got inspired by it. I took the concepts of Promises and callbacks in Javascript on a philosophical level.</p>\n<p>Working Synchronously is the easy option. Async is hard to code and to practice in real life.</p>\n<p>Living async means writing negligible number of messages/emails which require you to constantly wait until there is response. They block you from continuing to work on something else. Living async means lesser number of unimportant meetings and sync ups. In fact, when I used to be stuck in the beginning, I used to write my doubts as long expressive messages and would not expect a response immediately. I think I learnt this from the Open Source communities. ;)</p>\n<p><em>Edit: Some folks asked me on twitter to elaborate on this, so I wrote a follow up blog post about <a href=\"https://orkohunter.net/blog/live-asynchronously/\">living asynchronously</a>.</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"working-concurrently\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#working-concurrently\" aria-label=\"working concurrently permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Working concurrently</h3>\n<p>I always took two or more concurrent (independent) tasks at the same time. If I get blocked or maybe bored with the first task, I would switch to the second one and would wait until I get unblocked. It is not feasible when the first task is huge. But even then, it can be broken down into chunks of concurrent pieces. And then, I would \"parallelly process\" them on my end.</p>\n<h3 id=\"writing-daily-notes\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#writing-daily-notes\" aria-label=\"writing daily notes permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Writing daily notes</h3>\n<p>I used to take notes aggressively when I started working. I would write more than 100 words each day. I would publish them on an internal Confluence space.</p>\n<p>The main reasons for doing this were -</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>We forget</strong>. The meetings with our managers, mentors and coworkers in our first month are crucial. They convey some of the most important things about the company, team, project, etc. It was important for me to write <em>all</em> of it down.</li>\n<li><strong>Self review</strong>. At the end of the day, I would go through my notes and publish a summary of things I did, things I learnt, etc. It would take 10 minutes each day. My quarterly self reviews used to be very very long and exhaustive, since I had the logs of what I did. After six months, I changed the frequency of publishing the logs to weekly, but I would still take daily private notes.</li>\n<li><strong>Being public</strong>. My page was easily accessible by visiting <code class=\"language-text\">go/himanshu</code> from inside the company. I loved that I was being transparent about how I am spending my time in the company. And it also helped my indirect co-workers to know what I do here.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"docs-docs-code-docs-docs-technical-specs\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#docs-docs-code-docs-docs-technical-specs\" aria-label=\"docs docs code docs docs technical specs permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Docs, docs. code. docs. docs.

Hopefully, the travel is permitted by then. My work will be related to Spotify's newly open sourced project called <a href=\"https://github.com/spotify/backstage\">Backstage</a>. Spotify has been developing this for four years and has now decided to open source it, to simplify the infrastructure complexity in companies. Check it out, you'll find it interesting. <a href=\"https://backstage.io/\">backstage.io</a></p>\n<p>I am personally very excited that I will get to work closely with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/decause/\">Remy Decausemaker</a> again. Remy was my direct manager at Twitter. He now leads the Open Source program at Spotify. I have learnt so much about Open Source in the time that I have worked with him and I feel blessed that there lies more. :)</p>\n<p>As far as I know from Spotify engineering blogs and the people, it has a strong engineering culture. Teams (Squads) have autonomy of the work they do. People share knowledge and support collaboration and individual growth. I intend to stay in the company for long and hopefully I come out as a much better engineer.</p>\n<p>Plus, Spotify is a product that I have been using for many years. It has helped me find artists who have touched my soul. I am very excited about what lies ahead.</p>\n<p>Cheers!</p>","timeToRead":7}},{"node":{"id":"f31ff6b2-36bd-5f06-a4f8-df3f13c13c60","frontmatter":{"categories":["Tech"],"date":"Apr 2020","draft":false,"slug":"/blog/pep8speaks-5000-projects","subtitle":"A blog post to celebrate this milestone! 💖","summary":"I made the first commit to PEP8Speaks in Dec 2016.

My main concern is that debugging PEP8Speaks is not straightforward.\nI want to make the development process smooth. This means the project can be maintained by more people, not one person.</p>\n<p>PEP8Speaks can be installed on public repositories with a few clicks, but running on private repositories is not trivial.\nI have written the <a href=\"https://github.com/OrkoHunter/pep8speaks/wiki/Instructions-to-deploy-a-fork\">instructions to do it</a>.\nThere are currently <a href=\"https://github.com/search?q=pep8speaks&#x26;type=Users\">9 private forks</a> of PEP8Speaks, that I know of.\nBut, I want to make it easier for private repositories to start using it. Just like\nrunning CircleCI or Codecov on private repos.</p>\n<p>The last most important thing in my mind is to improve the infrastructure. Write more developer-focused documentation, technical spec\nof the project and support new contributions.</p>\n<p>Cheers!</p>","timeToRead":6}},{"node":{"id":"61070536-f22e-56f1-a2c8-2f07184c95c8","frontmatter":{"categories":["Tech","Non-Tech"],"date":"Feb 2020","draft":false,"slug":"/blog/bfs-vs-dfs-in-friendships","subtitle":"In real life friendships, some prefer Breadth First Search, but some fancy Depth First Search","summary":"In real life friendships, some prefer Breadth First Search, but some fancy Depth First Search.

We start with one node and traverse the entire graph until we find what we are looking for.</p>\n<p>There are many ways to do that, but the two most popular ones are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search\">Breadth First Search (BFS)</a>\nand <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search\">Depth First Search (DFS)</a>. The name of the method is key to what do they do.</p>\n<p>In BFS, we search all the neighbour nodes first. And then search the 2nd-degree neighbours, then 3rd-degree, and so on. Here is a neat animation from Wikipedia for you.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/Animated_BFS.gif\" alt=\"BFS GIF\"></p>\n<p>But in DFS, we start with a neighbour and keep going in its branch as deep as we can, and then backtrack to a second neighbour and go deep into its branch, and so on.</p>\n<p>Read the wikipedia articles if you want to know more. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search\">BFS</a> &#x26; <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search\">DFS</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-are-you-saying\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#what-are-you-saying\" aria-label=\"what are you saying permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>What are you saying?</h2>\n<p>BFS and DFS can be seen among people as traits of how they make friends.

Why did you do it?</h2>\n<p><strong>1. Accountability</strong></p>\n<p>Writing letters is hard. It is a kind gesture from your side but it takes time to collect your thoughts and write them down in succinct words. I have spent from three hours to a few days on each letter. Hence, it is hard to keep writing even when I want to. The awareness that I have a public space on my website, will keep me accountable to update it and to write more.</p>\n<p><strong>2. It may inspire someone to write letters</strong></p>\n<p>I wish more people write letters. A letter can do wonders if you want to convey a message with impact. We choose texts to communicate daily. People forget messages sent over Facebook and Whatsapp. But people remember letters and often re-read them in future.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Some of the correspondences are so good that I want to share</strong></p>\n<p>Some letters along with their responses are thoughtful and fantastic read for me. I thought I should share them publicly.

It’s really easy to confuse it with genuine love. But for me anyway, infatuation is a lot more like a drug.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It’s a feeling that consumes you with temporary euphoric highs, and deep, dark lows. It’s almost like a panicked state of obsession. It fills your brain so all you can think about is that person. You start to care less about what really matters in your own life...your goals, your friends, your work. All that matters when you’re infatuated, is them. And you feel a strong, leeching desire to mold yourself into the person you think they’d want you to be.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When you’re infatuated with someone, when that person gets closer to you in any way, you feel a rush. Like you’re on cloud 9. Like you just popped a bunch of really good ecstasy. And it feels amazing in the moment. But then when you sense them distancing from you in any way...an ignored text. A rescheduled date. Flirting with another person. Going out on the town without you. Whatever. It feels like the world is crumbling...like you’re going through a withdrawal. You panic and fear you’re going to lose them. There’s a constant push/pull. In those moments of panic all you care about is pulling them back to you. Those up and downs can be maddening over time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>At its core, I think infatuation is latching onto the idealized picture your brain paints of someone. ... You feel in love with them even though you barely know what’s it like to really be with them. ... You start thinking crazy thoughts like “this person is perfect”...”this person is the solution to all of my problems, if I can just keep them I’ll be fulfilled”...”if I can’t have this person I’ll never be genuinely happy”. You think you’re madly in love. But it’s all shallow. Once that person actually starts getting closer to you...the infatuation can wear off pretty quickly...and you can be left feeling confused and deflated. Like a spent firework.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I think most “love at first sight”, and honeymoon periods is really just infatuation. It can turn into love, but it’s not really. And sometimes if you’re not careful, it can blind you and drag you down into some really dark places.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Love on the other hand, is a lot more comfortable. It’s less erratic. It grows slowly over time and stays pretty constant. Its the general feeling of caring and warmth towards someone. You can hate someone in a current moment, but still love them overall. You can find someone to be unattractive, or incompatible...and still love them deep down. You can have a fight with the person you love, and not fear you’re going to lose them...you just want to revolve it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It’s not like a drug...it doesn’t have the highs and lows of infatuation. Its gotta be cultivated and nurtured. You don’t lose yourself in it, or have the drive to turn into the person they want you to be...love helps you find yourself, and drives you to become the person you want to be. Love for a partner isn’t too different than the love you feel for a blood relative. It can be subtle and mellow...sometimes barely recognizable...but it’s always there. You’re connected to them at a deep primal level.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<p>This left me thinking for some time. Some of my thoughts:</p>\n<p><strong>We have little control over our Infatuation, but Love is a practice</strong>. It is comforting to know that love is not a fixed biological property which is set since birth. It is so much about our choices. We can learn to love and become one with it. We can teach people to practice love. Infact, there exists a very profoud meditation technique called \"Loving-Kindness\".</p>\n<p><strong>People can sometimes fall in love with their infatuation but never the person</strong>. This is so interesting to think about! This can give someone a feeling of being in love. But as the infatuation fades, the love fades as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Infatuation is not bad at all</strong>. It's as if, infatuation is our survival mechanism. But love goes beyond just surviving. It is spiritual.</p>\n<p><strong>Love is not an emotion</strong>. Happiness and Sadness come in phases. They are emotions. But love is always present, in us. Our mind may get distracted sometimes.

While some people would oversimplify this to the human body, others might overcomplicate and make this is a subject of spiritual mysticism. I want to remain sane on this topic and probably write the words which can make sense in daily life.</p>\n<p>For me, the majority of ‘I’ is divided into three parts or layers, namely the Brain, the Mind and the Consciousness. The Brain is the outermost layer, the frontier of the Self. Take a scenario for example. You are reading this text. The first ‘You’ is your eyes, receiving colorful light rays from the screen. The ‘You’ then converts this information into electrical signals for further processing. This part is called Brain. It is an entirely physical entity, made of matter which interacts with the outer world through our senses, i.e., sight, touch, smell, taste, and sound.</p>\n<p>The Brain is very close to a computer program, and vice versa. It is programmed to execute in a definite manner. When given a set of inputs, it runs the required number and type of processes and is done with it. It encounters bugs in its lifetime which causes the dysfunctioning of some module. It also has a computing power and needs resources such as oxygen and food.</p>\n<p>The Brain then tries to pass this information to our Consciousness but in comes the Mind. The Mind is that child of ours, whom we love so much that we probably can never stop listening to. The Mind constitutes of our thoughts, our emotions associated with those thoughts, reactions and Ego. If you have disliked this essay so far, your brain has nothing to do with it; it just is feeding the information to your Mind, which is sitting only to judge the content.

It is a thoughtless entity. It can interchangeably be understood as ‘the energy of life’. If you have ever been a psychonaut, this is the ‘vibration’ part of self, and it does communicate to other consciousness. If your consciousness is unaware of something which only your brain and mind knows (Take the statement ‘<em>We should love everyone</em>’ for example), it is entirely possible that you might react unexpectedly in extreme situations, contradictory to what you think you should never have done.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-chariot\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-chariot\" aria-label=\"the chariot permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The Chariot</h3>\n<p>Do you remember the scene from the epic Mahabharat? During the battle scene, the chariot with the most attention was of Arjun. Now there’s a great symbolism to be drawn from the setting. There is Arjun with all the weapons, perplexed with the myriad of thoughts about the battle, sitting on a chariot with Krishna, who is calm and patiently replying to all of the questions thrown by Arjun. Krishna is also the charioteer, holding the reins. There are horses driving the chariot, and finally, there’s the battleground, the vast ground where the chariot can roam around and interact with other chariots and other entities.</p>\n<p>Collectively if we are to compare this one picture with ‘I,’ the chariot is similar to a Body. Arjun is like the Mind having all of its thoughts, ego, and confusions. Krishna is the inner Consciousness. The reins connect the Mind with the horses, which are to be interpreted as the senses we use to interact with the external world, which here is the entire battleground of Kurukshetra. The ‘I’ functions when everything is at their place, resonating in perfect coordination.</p>\n<p>After all the questionnaire (popularly known as Bhagavad Gita), Krishna drives the chariot and is only capable of waking Arjun up and channeling all of his powers. I don’t know how reliable this symbolism should be held but loosely it’s very similar to the game of Mind and Consciousness.</p>\n<h3 id=\"change\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#change\" aria-label=\"change permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Change</h3>\n<p><em>How are these entities altered?</em></p>\n<p>Changing the Brain is straightforward. One can close their eyes, put on earphones with music and there, the state of their Brain is now different. But closing the eyes does not mean the person shall stop thinking about it. The change in Brain has little to no effects on the Mind.</p>\n<p>Changing the Mind is a tedious process. It requires expertise to govern thoughts from coming in and going out. It is a long process to gain control over one’s Ego. These methods can be classified under various Meditative techniques.</p>\n<p>Changing the Consciousness makes you a Psychonaut. A Psychonaut is a person who experiences intentionally induced altered states of consciousness and claims to use the experience to investigate his or her Mind, and possibly address spiritual questions, through direct experience. A change in Consciousness will, by default, reflect on the Mind and the Brain as well.</p>\n<p>When people talk about Enlightenment, they mean altered Consciousness and not a new Mind. All the humans feel love, sadness, hate, anger, etc., every single one of us and is, in fact, one of the traits which define us. A monk in the Himalayas is undoubtedly not deprived of Mind, but they probably know how to open up with the Consciousness directly and not let Mind be a middle-man.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Enlightenment doesn’t care how we reach there. — Thaddeus Golas</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The consciousness can be altered with prolonged meditation (very subjective to the technique and the person). The use of naturally occurring mushrooms containing psilocybin, DMT, LSD and many other psychedelic and psychoactive substances can also challenge Consciousness to its very core.</p>\n<h3 id=\"communication\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#communication\" aria-label=\"communication permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Communication</h3>\n<p>I’m not sure if there is any test to know whether some information which was thrown at us, has reached our consciousness or not. Merely hearing it ensures Brain level perception. Pondering over it as a thought provides that it is floating in our Mind. But how can we know if our Consciousness is aware of it?</p>\n<p>There is one practice which can make sure the thought isn’t stuck in the Mind. The method is to “Avoid Overthinking.” Overthinking is terrible. It is a risky business. On the one hand, it opens up new insights to a thought, on the other side it leads to the loss of reality and makes it very hard for any information to escape from our Minds. Another good practice is to not letting our Ego come into the picture. We can do it by not allowing our subjective feelings and judgment interfere while we catch a piece of information.</p>\n<p>Knowing that ‘I’ can be dissolved into these three entities can have very positive effects while communicating with others. If we can see that our words will be reflected by their layer of Ego, there is no way we can deliver our message to them despite speaking for any length of time, since it will never reach their Consciousness. We can then find out the correct choice of words to avoid their shiny surface of Mind which is eager to reflect anything that is thrown towards it such that it pierces through and reaches their Consciousness.</p>\n<p>Many times, we have the tendency to solve a problem with another person, just by speaking to them. Example can be a conflict of interest with our parents, friends or a significant other. But it’s wise to understand that the situation might have left the Mind of the other person very confused, and it’s best not to talk since our words will quickly bounce off them. It’s better to sit back, wait, till they work out with their Mind and are ready to communicate. Interesting to note that this is counter-intuitive to our Minds which quickly reacts by blabbering out whatever we can.</p>\n<h3 id=\"i-am-not-mythoughts\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#i-am-not-mythoughts\" aria-label=\"i am not mythoughts permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>I am not my Thoughts</h3>\n<p>Why is “watching the breath” one of the first and simplest meditation techniques? During Vipassana, it is suggested to start first by the practice of watching the whole breathing cycle and rather focus on the nostrils. This is not Vipassana, but it acts as an anchor to calm the Mind so that we would be able to do the actual practice. We can give an analogy of the mind to that of a chattering monkey. The Mind usually does not shut up and keeps feeding us with thoughts, ego, and their effects. We then tell the Mind, “O hey! Do you see this? Do you see me inhaling and exhaling? It’s beautiful, isn’t it? Watch!”. It’s like giving a crying baby, a toy to play with and making her come at ease.</p>\n<p>Once we start watching our thoughts, we begin to accept, and later appreciate the meaninglessness of them. Merely by watching them come and go, we build up a tolerance for a reaction, and it stops us from engaging from them in the future. We learn how futile are our thoughts, opinions, and judgments. Often at times, people are afraid of meaninglessness, which makes them value their thoughts very much. This makes them misinterpret that they are their thoughts, and thus, they build up a thick layer over their Consciousness, which is another meaningless and thoughtless entity. There is a possibility that life gets more beautiful if we stop yearning for everything to be meaningful.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ego\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#ego\" aria-label=\"ego permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Ego</h3>\n<p>Ego is a word which has been overstated and misunderstood a lot of times. Never is one’s true ego positive or negative, it’s the thoughts associated with it. A negative thought pattern can be removed while keeping the Ego intact. We just can’t let it happen very easily, since it’s so powerful. Ego is the ID of the Mind; it’s what makes us respond to someone calling our name. It might sound blissful to live after ‘Ego Death’, but that’s not how anyone can survive. Killing one’s ego is killing Self.</p>\n<p>If ego death isn’t desirable, then what is? Here is a comment from <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/43oysz/how_is_ego_death_beneficial/czjv2nn/\">/r/Psychonaut</a> which I find very relevant.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Personally, I don’t believe complete Ego death is possible, or even desirable. What I suggest is mastery of the Ego. Think of it like a wild animal to be tamed instead of destroyed. It is a part of you, an integral and important one, in fact, but for most people, it’s grown monstrous and completely out of control. Or put differently, it is in full control. And so we become passengers in these meat machines, with the Ego at the wheel. Dangerous stuff!\nThe Ego is only the Ego so long as it remains distinct and separate from the rest of you. The process we should undergo is what Carl Jung called individuation: the uniting of a fractured mind, of a psyche, compartmentalized and segregated into individual parts; the merging of conscious and unconscious, Self and Ego, reasoning mind and intuitive mind. The result is that we become indivisible, whole, balanced, and more importantly, in control.\nHow does this benefit you? Well, imagine two pilots wrestling for control of the ship. Good luck getting to your destination! Or better yet, good luck agreeing on a target. Before individuation, we’re torn and divided, conflicted and confused. We’re being driven, not doing the driving, you see? The Ego wants one thing, the Self another, and then it’s a battle for control. Or else the Ego is whispering sweet lies, and the Self is buying them wholesale so that the Self comes to believe that it and the Ego are one. This is a nice little tactic by the Ego, and one that can be observed in people on a daily basis. Defensiveness is an obvious indication of Ego identification. What are you defending? An opinion? A belief? A role? These things are not you, only things you do or things you cling to, but the Ego grows strong from false identification and so pokes and prods you into getting your back up whenever these are called into question.\nHow do you merge with the shadow? The first step is identifying it in yourself by distinguishing between the essential you — the Self, or pure consciousness — and the stuff that isn’t you. By watching your thoughts, words, and actions, seeking out incoherence and contradictions, defensiveness and sore spots, and then calling these into question. Be harsh with yourself. And whatever you do, don’t shy away from the ugly bits: that’s where the Ego likes to hide out.### Ignorance</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Don’t we hate it when we write or speak all the facts and support our argument while the person on the other side just <em>chooses</em> to ignore those and raises some of their own? It is happening every second on Facebook and Twitter comments section, and it’s eating out a lot of Brains. But why do people choose to be ignorant?</p>\n<p>The moment we add our entire Mind in the equation of <em>thought process</em>, it by default, includes the sensations in our body, emotional reactions, opinions, and separately, the Brainly activities, i.e., Reading/Listening and Writing/Speaking. Now, the Brain has no trouble in receiving any argument, neither the Consciousness has; but it’s the Mind, and if the words are causing any unpleasant sensations, we tend to reject it. And that’s where we lose.</p>\n<p>No sensation is either good or bad. However, it <em>will</em> arise. It’s natural for all of us. The key is not in ceasing it, but accepting it, accepting that impermanence is a real thing. The sensations have come, only to pass away.

I am very impressed by Yuval Noah Harari’s understanding of the consciousness and the scientific aspects of it, written in his book <em>Homo Deus</em>. To me, understanding one’s consciousness is a very complicated subject since it’s very easy to overthink it. It is the subjective ability to experience. Anything can be an experience, merely sitting somewhere alone in lush green, or talking to a person, or watching the leaves fall from a tree, anything and everything can become an experience and our consciousness is responsible for the subjective aspects of it.</p>\n<p>I’m not capable of writing about it. I’m not capable of using terms like ‘Vibration’ and ‘Energy’ to describe it. But I secretly wish, for a scientific explanation in centuries when we’d be pondering over the consciousness of Artificial Intelligence. Even if I can see things as it is (it’s the literal meaning of <em>Vipassana</em>), I wish things to be proven for a systematic understanding by the humanity. Wait, what is String Theory <em>again</em>?</p>","timeToRead":11}},{"node":{"id":"f63e11f2-791b-57e4-a1dd-9eb70b55e096","frontmatter":{"categories":["Tech","Non-Tech"],"date":"Mar 2018","draft":false,"slug":"/blog/delete-facebook","subtitle":"","summary":"","title":"#DeleteFacebook"},"html":"<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 800px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/f0d3d55e0329b720331a068b6e7e97fa/78d47/deleted.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 54.24%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n          <source\n              srcset=\"/static/f0d3d55e0329b720331a068b6e7e97fa/529ab/deleted.webp 625w,\n/static/f0d3d55e0329b720331a068b6e7e97fa/cf465/deleted.webp 800w\"\n              sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"\n              type=\"image/webp\"\n            />\n          <source\n            srcset=\"/static/f0d3d55e0329b720331a068b6e7e97fa/b1b4f/deleted.png 625w,\n/static/f0d3d55e0329b720331a068b6e7e97fa/78d47/deleted.png 800w\"\n            sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"\n            type=\"image/png\"\n          />\n          <img\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n            src=\"/static/f0d3d55e0329b720331a068b6e7e97fa/78d47/deleted.png\"\n            alt=\"deleted\"\n            title=\"deleted\"\n            loading=\"lazy\"\n            decoding=\"async\"\n            style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n          />\n        </picture>\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>After letting Facebook Inc. build a vast profile of me for 9 years, I deleted my facebook account.

If we pick two homo sapiens on earth, we can classify their relationship as one of these three types:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>An Acquaintance (Both of them are acquainted with each other)</li>\n<li>Unfamiliarity (No one knows about the existence of other)</li>\n<li>Celebrity status (One of the two is famous)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Today is the dawn of the 21st century. And every day in my college I meet few people who fall in none of the three types.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Every day I see people on 2.2, whom I know by face and name, as well as they know me and my name. But we don’t stop to say, ‘Hi’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>These are my <em>pseudo-acquaintances</em> whom I got to know from Facebook.</em></p>\n<p>Here is the deal. Somewhere in the data centers of Facebook Inc, there is a matrix which stores the connection between two nodes, and the edge value of those people and me is True. There have been numerous CSS divs containing strings which either they or I have written, which got a click from the other, sometimes a further div of “comment” as well. Somehow, subconsciously my brain understood that a person and I had interacted a whole bunch and thus we are friends. But when the same mind physically spots them in public, that same person for the first time in months, there is no surge of emotions to go and talk to them.</p>\n<p>I know someone on Facebook, I “interact” with them, but I don’t speak with the same passion or eagerness to them in real life, using flesh and bones. For me, it is terrifying. What if people eventually stop using their mouth for conversations because Whatsapp and Messenger let them use that gif meme to convey more efficiently. What if we discover some other app or platform to express ourselves in the best way which is different than meeting the person and using our mouth, eyes, face, hands or smile to express?</p>\n<p>And the fact that the first world countries already have incorporated a bit of this culture, raises merely questions about parenting. What if we are not concerned about our children, and the first friend they make, do not physically exist around them. I am surely, not saying one is better than others; there are so many pros of the Scientific Revolution, Internet being a tiny monster of it. I am just saying that, are people responsible? Is Facebook responsible enough to know that it has created an illusion of friendships and relationship and does it care about it? From the weekly product and feature launches, for the sole purpose of us interacting more on their platform, and increasing their value as advertisers and not looking up from our phones, I think it does not care at all. Or is it in control of anyone to care about it? Something like a trained Deep Learning model, over which we only have very few control after some time.</p>\n<hr>\n<br>\n> This article above was an email to a few close friends, right after I realized my first pseudo-acquaintance. I am thankful to their responses, they made me rethink every bit.\n<p>It has been quite long since I joined Facebook.com and I have spent a lot of time with the product. I have met and stayed connected with a lot of people using this platform, and therefore, I am probably thankful for it. However, here is my current setup, as of now:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I don’t use the product ‘news feed’. I use a version of News Feed Eradicator.</li>\n<li>I ran a custom Javascript script to unfollow all of my Facebook friends and then turned on the notifications for few, as I deemed necessary in my real life.</li>\n<li>On the phone, I do not have the Facebook app and I use messenger with the setting where I do not receive any notification (interrupts) but I would instead open the app to see if there any new messages.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The last thing that I want to say is that there are mostly no good and no wrong sides. As a human, we always have to use our discretion and find something in between. Hence I can not blindly delete Facebook to solve this problem, I’ll have to see the way to use it for my productivity, as long as it doesn’t consume a lot of my time to do that.</p>\n<hr>\n<br>\nUpdate, [I deleted my Facebook account](https://medium.com/@OrkoHunter/deletefacebook-10f365c5d36e).","timeToRead":3}},{"node":{"id":"28b35707-76b1-5495-ac81-09995417b825","frontmatter":{"categories":["Tech"],"date":"Feb 2018","draft":false,"slug":"/blog/twitter-vs-facebook","subtitle":"","summary":"","title":"Design of Public Posts: Twitter vs Facebook"},"html":"<blockquote>\n<p>What design tells you about the company’s values</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Both Facebook and Twitter allow posts to be publicly accessible by people who have not joined the platform.

And the Stage 1 has <em>zero</em> information about the post (which was the sole purpose of opening that particular URL). The only way to close this banner is to find that tiny <em>Not Now</em> text below the big Green <em>Create New Account</em>. An interesting design flaw (whether intentional or by mistake) is that the typography of <em>Not Now</em> and <em>Forgotten Account?</em> is exactly the same, even when the later button is clicked once a hundred times and the former 99 out of 100 times. I think it’s intentional.</p>\n<p>Let’s click on <em>Not Now</em>, and move the <strong>Stage 2</strong> of the view.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 1000px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/d638c58618ade228ab512a304d3e88bc/1263b/1*DjkjiZQ7_yC_IADORFLO_Q.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 57.76%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n          <source\n              srcset=\"/static/d638c58618ade228ab512a304d3e88bc/529ab/1*DjkjiZQ7_yC_IADORFLO_Q.webp 625w,\n/static/d638c58618ade228ab512a304d3e88bc/80c60/1*DjkjiZQ7_yC_IADORFLO_Q.webp 1000w\"\n              sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"\n              type=\"image/webp\"\n            />\n          <source\n            srcset=\"/static/d638c58618ade228ab512a304d3e88bc/b1b4f/1*DjkjiZQ7_yC_IADORFLO_Q.png 625w,\n/static/d638c58618ade228ab512a304d3e88bc/1263b/1*DjkjiZQ7_yC_IADORFLO_Q.png 1000w\"\n            sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"\n            type=\"image/png\"\n          />\n          <img\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n            src=\"/static/d638c58618ade228ab512a304d3e88bc/1263b/1*DjkjiZQ7_yC_IADORFLO_Q.png\"\n            alt=\"1 DjkjiZQ7 yC IADORFLO Q\"\n            title=\"1 DjkjiZQ7 yC IADORFLO Q\"\n            loading=\"lazy\"\n            decoding=\"async\"\n            style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n          />\n        </picture>\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>On this webpage, the area covered with the information about the post is still comparable or maybe less than the <em>engageble area of log in and sign up</em>.

Some got the <em>success</em> while some are still trying. But to my astonishment, I found that the degree of comfort in each one of them was not as expected. What I mean by that is, not everyone who got this success was happy, and not everyone who failed was sad, although the majority was skewed on the side of the former case.</p>\n<p>As I broadened my perspective and timeframe, I found that getting a job which pays in money, is not something which can give satisfaction to every human being. We cannot universally advise this to everyone. If you think so, then please understand the gravity of human population on this planet, and my concern was about satisfaction which is difficult to define, since a large part of it loses touch with materialism.</p>\n<p>So, I aligned my line of thought with <strong><em>loving the work we do</em></strong>. If a farmer spends the day on their field, and they enjoy it, then it’s good, isn’t it? How about the software engineer who thinks their technology can help people or maybe due to some other reason, they find love in the code, they write? I found that it was closer to being a ubiquitous activity which can keep people happy, or at least a large number of humans. But then, I saw people who do not have any job at first place. By <em>job</em>, I mean an activity which benefits people and provides something (<em>e.g. salary</em>) in return for the individual. But there are wanderers, <em>fakirs</em>, hitchhikers and many types of <em>unemployed</em> people. So, are they different from <em>regular</em>? These people challenged the universality of this line of thought.</p>\n<p>It further gave me an idea that instead of (or along with) loving the work, we also need to <strong><em>enjoy with the peers who surround us</em></strong>. So, a lot of human beings are embraced by their parents, friends and/or children. It does not happen always, but we can still find some of these in different bandwidths of our life. It reminded me of the letter by Richard Feynman, <a href=\"https://fs.blog/2014/08/richard-feynman-what-problems-to-solve\">Do not remain nameless to yourself</a>. So yeah, Living in love can be a universal thing to do. And it allowed me to picture this massive population of ours on the planet earth. But then, I found exceptions. I thought of Chris McCandless (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Into_the_Wild_%28film%29\"><em>Into the wild</em></a>) and how he did not find love in his family but Nature.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 1000px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/2b689703566016580f720f5e5f33e1dc/0a251/into_the_wild.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 41.6%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n          <source\n              srcset=\"/static/2b689703566016580f720f5e5f33e1dc/529ab/into_the_wild.webp 625w,\n/static/2b689703566016580f720f5e5f33e1dc/80c60/into_the_wild.webp 1000w\"\n              sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"\n              type=\"image/webp\"\n            />\n          <source\n            srcset=\"/static/2b689703566016580f720f5e5f33e1dc/0f1e4/into_the_wild.jpg 625w,\n/static/2b689703566016580f720f5e5f33e1dc/0a251/into_the_wild.jpg 1000w\"\n            sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"\n            type=\"image/jpeg\"\n          />\n          <img\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n            src=\"/static/2b689703566016580f720f5e5f33e1dc/0a251/into_the_wild.jpg\"\n            alt=\"A scene from the movie Into the Wild\"\n            title=\"A scene from the movie Into the Wild\"\n            loading=\"lazy\"\n            decoding=\"async\"\n            style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n          />\n        </picture>\n  </a>\n    </span>\n    <figcaption class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figcaption\">A scene from the movie Into the Wild</figcaption>\n  </figure></p>\n<p>I was back to square one. Do we need another human being to live this life, happily? People can not always surround us. And further, outside of seven billion humans, there are other lives as well. What about dogs, or the trees, plants, and flowers which are alive? Or a lost animal somewhere in the jungle. Do they have to have a peer to share the love or their <em>pursuit of happiness</em>?</p>\n<p>My problem set got bigger, and I appreciated <em>how difficult it must be for a democracy to form its constitution</em> or King Hammurabi to write his <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_Hammurabi\">code</a>. At this point, I felt a little exhausted in finding the answer to my question (it had been several months by now).</p>\n<p>But a few days ago, as I was practicing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vipassan%C4%81#Vipassana-meditation_in_the_modern_Vipassana_movement\">Vipassana Meditation</a>, I had an epiphany about the question. I realized how much did I miss to observe about my own physical body even when there was so much going on already. I never noticed my breath on its whole (trust me, when I say, I still have not). The moment we start to breathe in, and it goes on for a full length, and then it stops. A moment of no activity, and then we breathe out. And the cycle repeats. Breathing is just one of the many involuntary signs of life, and yet it goes on unnoticed. It made me regard the totality around me, even more. To mention a few, the breeze which blows past me when I stroll on <a href=\"https://wiki.metakgp.org/w/2.2\">2.2</a>, the distant sound I listen to while typing this text, the leaves which fall off from the trees when I sit with a cup of <em>chai</em> at <a href=\"https://www.google.co.in/maps/place/Bhaski%27s/@22.3161081,87.2988514,21z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x3a1d43feddbb1c35:0xeff718f07e02348!8m2!3d22.3159891!4d87.2987071\">Bhaski’s</a>, and other many signs of life.</p>\n<p>I think, for the question of <em>“What is something which should be the universal action of everyone?”</em>, I can put it in words as “<em>To witness”</em>. We necessarily do not have to think, question, or react to the activities around us or <em>even inside us</em>, but to just witness the presence of life. In Sanskrit, we call this state of no-mind as निर्विचार. I felt that generally, we are ignorant of ourselves and we miss to observe a lot. With this awareness and focus, the decisions we make are quite apparent, and we can then work on optimizing our limited time on this planet to do something.</p>","timeToRead":4}},{"node":{"id":"fc57b818-1592-5b76-858c-ddc96f2415b7","frontmatter":{"categories":["Tech"],"date":"May 2017","draft":false,"slug":"/blog/python-easter-eggs","subtitle":"","summary":"","title":"Python's easter eggs and hidden jokes"},"html":"<blockquote>\n<p>Just when you thought, Python could not be more fun.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"read-on-github\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#read-on-github\" aria-label=\"read on github permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Read on GitHub</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/OrkoHunter/python-easter-eggs\">https://github.com/OrkoHunter/python-easter-eggs</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"1-hello-world\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#1-hello-world\" aria-label=\"1 hello world permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>1.

Great ones know what to rewrite (and reuse).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Plan to throw one [version] away; you will, anyhow. (Copied from Frederick Brooks’ <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_S._Raymond\">The Mythical Man-Month</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you have the right attitude, interesting problems will find you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When you lose interest in a program, your last duty to it is to hand it off to a competent successor.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Treating your users as co-developers is your least-hassle route to rapid code improvement and effective debugging.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Release_early,_release_often\">Release early. Release often.</a> And listen to your customers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Smart data structures and dumb code works a lot better than the other way around.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you treat your beta-testers as if they’re your most valuable resource, they will respond by becoming your most valuable resource.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The next best thing to having good ideas is recognizing good ideas from your users. Sometimes the latter is better.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Often, the most striking and innovative solutions come from realizing that your concept of the problem was wrong.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Perfection (in design) is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but rather when there is nothing more to take away.

Beware of pseudo-secrets.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To solve an interesting problem, start by finding a problem that is interesting to you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Provided the development coordinator has a communications medium at least as good as the Internet, and knows how to lead without coercion, many heads are inevitably better than one.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar#Lessons_for_creating_good_open_source_software\"><em>Attribution</em></a></p>\n<hr>\n<p>These lessons are really something to be read periodically while developing and contributing to open source software.

But what people do now is that they post it on Instagram and then share it over Facebook. This is the most meaningless aspect of Facebook after pokes. Why do you expect someone to see (follow) your photos on Instagram if they do not know you at all? And if they do, you are definitely friends with them on Facebook.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Poorly composed pictures clearly showing you having fun</strong>\nWhy do people start migrating away from Facebook? This happened when their friends started using Facebook as a <em>PR tool</em>, to estabilish that they are living a good life, irrespective of the reality.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now, what would happen if you would post your party pictures, your fun trips stories on Instagram?

But like <a href=\"http://news.ycombinator.com\">Hacker News</a> and <a href=\"http://reddit.com\">Reddit</a> and unlike <a href=\"http://www.quitfacebookday.com/\">Facebook</a>, it is **okay <em>not to</em> <em>post,</em> but just consume the beauty out of it. So, put the peer pressure off and enjoy following <a href=\"http://www.creativebloq.com/photography/instagram-2131996\">some amazing photographers</a> on Instagram. And hey, it’s perfectly cool if you share your photography skills over there too ! It’s a social network after all. And it’s also alright if you click a cute picture of a child you spotted in a village. It’s great. Likeways, it’s okay if you post a picture of your own child. Or your spouse. Or your own. Hey wait, maybe I should watch the video again.</p>\n<p>**It’s okay to post a picture of a Human (and it’s not the same)</p>\n<p>Note that I don’t actually hate my friends on instagram. It’s just a momentary disgust, which vanishes away when I hangout with these amazing people.</p>\n<p>Update: <a href=\"/blog/delete-facebook/\">I deleted my Facebook and Instagram account.</a></p>","timeToRead":2}},{"node":{"id":"e2660377-1bd6-571f-b582-a2829557eebb","frontmatter":{"categories":["Tech"],"date":"Feb 2017","draft":false,"slug":"/blog/keep","subtitle":"","summary":"","title":"Keep : A personal shell command keeper"},"html":"<h2 id=\"a-meta-clitoolkit\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#a-meta-clitoolkit\" aria-label=\"a meta clitoolkit permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>A Meta CLI toolkit</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Writwick Wraj loves using the command line.\nWritwick googles “How to do X in terminal?” and multiple forums and blog posts finally provide him the magical <em>command</em> for the rescue.

Go to <a href=\"https://github.com/\">https://github.com</a>. Pick a username, enter your email id and choose a password. Next, choose <em>unlimited personal repositories for free</em>. In the final step you can give some input to github and voila ! You are now a github user. (If you are redirect from KWoC, use the username there.) There is plethora of git guides over internet, some are really good and some really suck. I here am writing a simple blog for the newbies who have successfully made an account over github and are really excited about it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>GitHub</strong> is a web-based Git repository hosting service, which offers some of the distributed revision control and source code management(SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. Unlike Git, which is strictly a command-line tool, GitHub provides a web-based graphical interface and desktop as well as mobile integration</p>\n<p>Or simply</p>\n<p><strong>Github connects you with other people who are interested in sharing and creating together.</strong></p>\n<p>So there are really two ways to begin with. Here goes the first one.</p>\n<p>Create a repository : Repository is what you call the stuff you are going to upload and work on. Go to <a href=\"https://github.com/new\">https://github.com/new</a> and create a repository. Let’s name it hello-world. \nAdd some description, or you might want to add it later. Initialize it with a Readme. It's a good practice and let's you clone it immediately. (Yeah right, see below)</p>\n<p>Clone it : Open your console, move to the directory where you want to work and do this.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">$ git clone https://github.com/username/hello-world.git</code></pre></div>\n<p>This will create a directory in your computer. Now, this isn’t a simple directory. It is a ‘clone’ of the github repository. You can say that the files in it are controlled by the version control system git and tracked with the repository on github. Note : If you have not installed git, see <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git\">this</a>.</p>\n<p>Do this,</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">$ cd hello-world\n$ git remote -v\norigin https://github.com/&lt;username>/hello-world.git (fetch)\norigin https://github.com/&lt;username>/hello-world.git (push)</code></pre></div>\n<p>This shows that the link to repository of yours at github is known by the name origin over here.</p>\n<p>Now, you will have to configure your name and your email address which you will be using for making the commits (don’t worry about what it means right now, we will cover it soon). This configuring is ideally done only once in a lifetime of your system (or unless you purposely remove your ~/.gitconfig file but that’s the story of another time).</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">$ git config --global user.name \"ABC XYZ\"\n$ git config --global user.email \"abc@xyz.com\"</code></pre></div>\n<p>Now another way of this is first you create the directory on your computer. Navigate inside it and do</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">$ git init</code></pre></div>\n<p>This will initialize an empty git repository inside it. Later, you can add the link to the repository by the git remote command like this</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">$ git remote add origin https://github.com/&lt;username>/hello-world</code></pre></div>\n<p>You can always use <code class=\"language-text\">git remote -v</code> command to track the aliases.</p>\n<p>Making the first change : Okay now we are in condition of adding some files or code to this repository. I am going to make a python file with hello world program and publish the change over the github repository too. \nSo make a new file say hello.py inside the directory, open it with your favorite editor and write the one line code to print whatever you want. Why just hello world? (Because dmr did it!) Now write it and save the file.</p>\n<p>The first thing you should always do is to see whether you have done any changes or not in the repository. This can be done by</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">$ git status</code></p>\n<p>After the changes you made, you must be getting this after git status</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">On branch master\n Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.\n Untracked files:\n (use \"git add &lt;file>...\" to include in what will be committed)\n hello.py\n nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \"git add\" to track)Add, Commit, Push! : In your console, do this.\n\n$ git add .</code></pre></div>\n<p>This adds all the files in the track which you have changed. \nNow it’s time to commit that change. By committing, git understands that you want the change to be in record. Every commit is accompanied with a message that appears on the log (git log). A commit should represent one logical change only which should be supported by a relevant commit message. The convention is to write the commit in the verbal form ie. tell the computer to do that for you. Do this</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">$ git commit -m \"add hello.py\"</code></p>\n<p>You’ve made your first commit! But it won’t be appearing over github, because you made the changes locally. You need to push it over the web. For that, you use</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">$ git push</code></p>\n<p>Or,</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">$ git push origin</code></p>\n<p>to say git where actually you are pushing it to. Or,</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">$ git push origin master</code></p>\n<p>to say git over what branch on origin you are pushing it to.</p>\n<p>That’s it! You’ve published your changes to your GitHub repository.</p>\n<p>NOTE : This is a very basic start. There are more concepts to be explored. You can search for specifics. StackOverflow also has great resources. We’ll leave the nitty gritties of Git for another day.</p>\n<p>Happy Coding!</p>","timeToRead":4}},{"node":{"id":"888d5da8-c324-542e-b94b-af2ddcb77bee","frontmatter":{"categories":["Non-Tech"],"date":"Jan 2017","draft":false,"slug":"/blog/aanshuon-ke-bimb-se","subtitle":"","summary":"","title":"आंसुओं के बिंब से छलकती हुई दुनिया, देखी थी मैंने एक बार"},"html":"<p>आंसुओं के बिंब से छलकती हुई दुनिया, देखी थी मैंने एक बार</p>\n<p>वक्त की गहराईयों में डूबती नज़र आई थी वो</p>\n<p>नज़रों से सहारा दिया मैंने</p>\n<p>ख़ुशी का भरोसा दिया मैंने</p>\n<p>न जाने मेरा हाथ क्यों न थामाँ उसने</p>\n<p>उसे गहराइयों की सुकूँ भाती चली गयी ।</p>\n<h1 id=\"\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#\" aria-label=\" permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>.</h1>\n<p>Thanks to Sandeep Jha for the first two lines.</p>","timeToRead":1}},{"node":{"id":"889998b1-5cc1-502b-a279-292be9c245f1","frontmatter":{"categories":["Non-Tech"],"date":"Jan 2017","draft":false,"slug":"/blog/erotomania","subtitle":"","summary":"","title":"Erotomania : An Unfortunate Tale"},"html":"<p>“Hey Wake up!</p>\n<p>Wake up, for you are left with just 30 more minutes.</p>\n<p>You better sleep after this is over; rather that would be your only choice.

So, get up, go get your hair combed, your teeth cleaned, and most importantly collect as much happy thoughts as possible in your stupid brain.”</p>\n<p>The only child of his parents, this kid was a loner, an antisocial introvert who liked to stay back in his shady living-slash-playing room, and wished to stay there for lifetime. Skipping school since the fourth grade, his mother very well accepted his social awkwardness as well as his mind’s disability and was happy with hiding it from the rest of the world. Whilst I, I watched him grow, I kept calling out for him, in his good times, or bad. I lived in him.</p>\n<p>When he was 10, his mother was relocated to a new place, around 50 kilometres from the capital, a place where neighbourhood was as far as the corner shop in the hometown. He was terrified. He had to greet the visitors all along. It was then, he met his first friend, a girl. After she came into his life, there was no shady place, in his house, or heart or anywhere. <em>‘I love when Vaidehi blinks and smiles at the same time’</em>, he’d say to his mom. One day, it was evident to him, that Vaidehi had the most beautiful eyes he’d ever seen. I still remember how his mother must have felt when she would have realised that his son had one more best friend now.</p>\n<p>His mother was long gone before he’d even think of proposing Vaidehi to marry. It was the same girl, the only girl he’d ever spoken two words to. He left his mother’s house and starting living with her at a completely new place. <em>‘I’ve kept your lunch in the kitchen, heat it carefully, okay? I’ll be back by 7'</em>, she used to say every morning to him, like a mother warning his kid before herself going out.</p>\n<p>Apart from his “work from home” job, he was passionate about clicking pictures. Or rather, he liked to save the moments he was enjoying with her. Some days, he used to shuffle between them, recollect the memories, shed a few tears, curl up on the bed and just wait for her to come in the evening. He was also good at dodging off important calls.</p>\n<p>Best were the college days, when he started perceiving how real, the real world was. He was afraid on the first day. Four years later, he had a job, a “work from home” job, a girlfriend, and no family. But he had learnt how to ignore bullies and be in love, or at least that’s what he’d think.</p>\n<p><em>‘Come in the City Hospital ASAP. Your wife is here.’</em> Some lady spoke on the phone. The call was from Vaidehi’s number. He rushed out, alone in the traffic and around so many people. He was little mad at her, why she didn’t take time off work during her last months.</p>\n<p><em>‘It’s a baby girl’</em>, The nurse announced.</p>\n<p><em>‘Let’s call her Gayatri’</em>, Vaidehi said.</p>\n<p><em>‘That’s a beautiful name’</em></p>\n<p><em>‘It’s your mother’s.’</em></p>\n<p><em>‘Oh yes. Of course.’</em></p>\n<p>As the Judge broke the nip of the pen, he declared : \n<em>‘According to the evidences presented by the accused himself and his self-admittance, the suspect, on charge of murdering his wife and his baby child, is hereby sentenced to be hanged till death on the month’s last day at sunrise. May God have mercy upon his soul.’</em></p>\n<p>She was drunk. One day, when she came home. Or maybe high, he could not figure, he remembers, during college days, she had mentioned one of her female friend who was into heroin at those times.</p>\n<p>Vaidehi’s call history. Her friend’s name in recent calls. She was definitely high.</p>\n<p>He could not dare speak a word to her. He made sure the little girl is fast asleep.</p>\n<p>She started abusing herself on daily basis. He was worried. He considered himself to be at fault. Maybe, she was not enjoying with him as much as he was. Maybe she didn’t love him like he did.</p>\n<p><em>‘Nah! That can’t be it.’</em></p>\n<p>Gayatri got into kinder garden. More house chores. Vaidehi couldn’t find time to visit her friend these days. She did go to work, but usually cut short her work hours in the evening. She was not happy.</p>\n<p><em>‘I will make her feel good.’</em> Maybe one more kid? Maybe pregnancy will stop her from drugs?

It was of a man.</p>\n<p>This is about the night, the night he became the “accused”. Vaidehi was chopping off vegetables in the kitchen. He was looking at Gayatri, smiling, wondering. He could not hold any longer. He sneaked in.</p>\n<p><em>‘Hey’</em></p>\n<p>_’Sorry I got late, had lots of pending work at office. Dinner would be ready soon.

His legs were trembling.</p>\n<p><em>‘Vaidehi, you love me right?’</em></p>\n<p><em>‘Yes’</em>, her lips were straight.</p>\n<p>He went straight to bed.

That woman had no love for you, but why are you still doing this for her? Just go home already.”</p>\n<p>The thick rope got around his neck. Eyes closed, hood on, memories started flashing in.

Your lean appearance, your light pink complexion and above of all, your aroma all blew up my mind.

I seemed to fall off when *Ramu kaka *took you out from the bag and placed you so close to me. I was breathing heavy. I felt as if a high voltage pulse entered me. I could notice all your features.

You had made an impact on me.</p>\n<p>And finally, our eyes met! I never felt so boozed up before then. Couple of my heartbeats were skipped. I was losing balance over the amount of current I was intaking. That made me fluctuate before you which would have hurt your eyes. But you kept looking at me or I should say I was getting nervous. Were you in love too? Did you like me too? But very soon you were carried away in the kitchen. You left me confused. And the sad part is, I never saw you even once since then.</p>\n<p>Finally, tonight it’s going to be the last night in my house. 3 days ago, our madam took a picture of me. I didn’t know why.

Due to my recent interests in Image Processing, I had made <a href=\"https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3AOrkoHunter+is%3Aclosed\">few</a> Pull Requests to the <a href=\"https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image\">scikit-image</a> library, but it did not participate in GSoC. And that, after all those years of consecutive partcipation! (Yes I felt little sad.)</p>\n<p>So, the day when Google announced the list of organizations, I started my “org hunt” ! And by the end of the day, I had sorted out the Python-only projects, which included the project <a href=\"http://timelabtechnologies.com/ideas.html\">Library of Time Series methods</a>. The project was to make a library with methods useful to the research in X-ray astronomy. I was thrilled by the idea! Nevertheless, I was not much aware of the astronomical aspects of it.</p>\n<p>In next 10–15 days, I submitted my proposal and few Pull Requests, among which I think <a href=\"https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray/pull/74\">refactoring the Lightcurve class</a> helped me understand the core of the library. In the pre-GSoC period, I also contributed in establishing Continuous Integration with <a href=\"https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray/pull/51\">Travis</a> for Unix and <a href=\"https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray/pull/63\">Appveyor</a> for Windows. Meanwhile, Stingray, the library we were working on, was re-designed to become an <a href=\"https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray/pull/52\">Astropy affiliated package</a>.</p>\n<p>In the wee hours of April 23, the results were announced and I <em>was</em> <a href=\"https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5755858201870336\">selected</a>! My primary and helping mentors were <a href=\"https://github.com/dhuppenkothen\">Daniela Huppenkothen</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/matteobachetti\">Matteo Bachetti</a>, both from different time zones, which really helped me in getting my answers as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>In the first ten days of the Community Bonding period, my end semester exams were going on. The main medium of the communication between my mentors and me was Slack. And I must say, we totally loved it.</p>\n<p>I started off with implementing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-spectrum\">Cross Spectra</a>, basing to a lot of work that was previously done by <a href=\"https://github.com/abigailStev\">Abigail Stevens</a>. Later on, Coherence and Lags were added in the Crossspectrum class, along with their tests and docstring.</p>\n<p>After the mid-terms the major work was to add the Covariance spectra, and its “Averaged” counter part as well, along with errors for both. My final PR was to add the simple matrix of Dynamical Powerspectrum, which is open as of now.</p>\n<p>Throughout this period, I was able to open <a href=\"https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3AOrkoHunter+is%3Aclosed\">22 Pull requests</a> and push <a href=\"https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray/commits/master?author=OrkoHunter\">116 commits</a> to the main repository <em>i.e.</em> StingraySoftware/Stingray.</p>\n<p>One thing that I would like to share, of many things which I learnt in this perioid, is that numpy booleans are little tricky. For e.g.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">In []: np.isfinite(100) is True\nOut[]: False</code></pre></div>\n<p>This is because np.isfinite or similar functions do not return the basic Python bool but an instance of numpy bool. And in the __eq__ magic method of the numpy bool class, it is evaluated to the Python booleans. And so, <code class=\"language-text\">np.isfinite(100) == True</code> would return True.</p>\n<p>That is all for now. It was a great experience for me, and I am very thankful to Daniela, Matteo and Abigail for all the help during the summer.</p>\n<p>Cheers!</p>","timeToRead":3}},{"node":{"id":"39af5725-6280-5330-b8ab-c2c00e20187e","frontmatter":{"categories":["Tech"],"date":"Jan 2017","draft":false,"slug":"/blog/losing-and-regaining-truct-on-gitignore","subtitle":"","summary":"","title":"Losing and Re-Gaining trust on .gitignore"},"html":"<p>I would like to share an interesting story of a problem which I’ve faced many times since I started using git.

I wasn’t supposed to push the pyc</em> files. Oh this looks so lame.</p>\n<p>If you’re amateur enough, not to feel uncomfortable after pushing those files, you’re golden. Else, you’ll think of something called .gitignore which helps in ignoring unwanted files to be added in your git repository.</p>\n<p>You’ll then search for a good gitignore file for Python and Google will give you exactly what you want, <a href=\"https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Python.gitignore\">Python.gitignore</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">wget -O .gitignore https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/master/Python.gitignore\ngit add -A\ngit commit -m \"Added .gitignore file\"</code></pre></div>\n<p>Now, you’ll try to remove the pyc files, using rm -rf *.pyc.

So, if you’ll remove the staged file (pyc files, in this case), git will say to you that you’ve deleted them.</p>\n<p>Later on, I googled the string “gitignore not working” and O thanks to stackoverflow, I was rescued.</p>\n<p>After adding the .gitignore, simply do this</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">git rm -rf --cached .\ngit add .</code></pre></div>\n<p>Or, instead of <code class=\"language-text\">rm -rf *.pyc</code></p>\n<p>, I must have done</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">git rm -rf *.pyc</code></p>\n<p>Ta-da !

As of me, I survived a whole semester of college with <a href=\"http://blog.orkohunter.net/touchpad-problem-with-asus-laptop-on-linux/\">my touchpad not working</a>. But that doesn’t mean I moved to emacs or vim. subl to open, pgup pgdn and arrow keys for navigation, ctrl + s to save, ctrl + t for new tab, I mean I had got everything done with my keyboard and the fact is that Chrome also obeys these commands (or vice-versa). Imagine you scrolling through a webpage and wondering why j and k are not helping you.</p>\n<p>The point I’m trying to make is why shouldn’t we encourage newbies to use the editor which makes their life really easy very fast so that they could simply learn how to code rather then learning how to code to code. Later on, let them decide whether they really dislike this editor and move on to something more challenging and I believe some people will surely move on to the challenging ones.</p>\n<p>But I will surely not.

Today, as I woke up at 8:30, nothing replaced my butter bread breakfast combination. And when I checked my facebook, it reminded me that today is Diwali! So, <em>\"Happy Diwali friends\"</em> is going to be my status too, as if just to tell 'em that I am celebrating too.</p>\n<p>The best thing is that even today happiness is alive. But the meaning is not the same. Earlier it was mainly because of the fest, today it's because of the one day holiday it rendered.</p>\n<p>I've made phone calls to my elder ones, touched their feet and received valuable suggestions to burn the crackers carefully. I know Dada ji had said exactly the same words somewhat 12 years ago. Who knows in advance that the childhood Diwali are the best ones we ever see in life?</p>\n<p>Here at IIT Kharagpur, we have something called Illumination on Diwali. More than a thousand diyas are used by a single hostel to create amazing designs. Here are some of their pictures. That's the only exciting thing I'm feeling about this Diwali.</p>\n<p><em>\"As there is so much light outside, I don't feel the need of putting any diya.
