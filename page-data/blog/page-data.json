It needs to have a way of writing extensions/plugins/apps to extend the product.</p>\n<p>And that is true for almost all of the softwares we use. It’s true if you really think about it. Think of all the things developers use today.</p>\n<p>Let’s start with more common examples. Smartphones and Computers. There were some good phones in 2007 but iPhone came and disrupted the market. What was so unique about it? It introduced the possibility of \"writing apps for phones\". And anyone could write them. We now have several billion dollar companies which are technically just apps.</p>\n<p>If iPhone was a batteries included phone, with Apple responsible for creating all the modern apps people use, we wouldn’t be here today. Same goes for all operating systems like Linux, macOS and Windows. They are all platforms.</p>\n<p>What’s the next thing a developer uses? Probably a browser. Even there, you can build chrome extensions, firefox plugins and what not.</p>\n<p>Not to forget some of the most popular websites in the world like youtube, facebook, amazon, twitter, spotify, etc. are conventionally platforms.</p>\n<p>What's next on a developer's minds? GitHub, Gitlab, etc. to host source code? You can build apps and integrations on them. It has it's own marketplace.</p>\n<p>You use VSCode, vim, emacs etc. to write code? People have been building plugins for them for more than 30 years. They have a marketplace too.</p>\n<p>Do you use Slack to communicate? You can build integrations and apps that run on Slack.</p>\n<p>iTerm2 as terminal? zsh as shell? Plugins, plugins, plugins everywhere!</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 720px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/cf2e5f163fad4cc35dea765394af52a5/64a54/plugins-everywhere.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 67.77777777777777%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n          <source\n              srcset=\"/static/cf2e5f163fad4cc35dea765394af52a5/7c297/plugins-everywhere.webp 180w,\n/static/cf2e5f163fad4cc35dea765394af52a5/33ecc/plugins-everywhere.webp 360w,\n/static/cf2e5f163fad4cc35dea765394af52a5/df77d/plugins-everywhere.webp 720w,\n/static/cf2e5f163fad4cc35dea765394af52a5/c4c4c/plugins-everywhere.webp 735w\"\n              sizes=\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\"\n              type=\"image/webp\"\n            />\n          <source\n            srcset=\"/static/cf2e5f163fad4cc35dea765394af52a5/98e5d/plugins-everywhere.jpg 180w,\n/static/cf2e5f163fad4cc35dea765394af52a5/543cd/plugins-everywhere.jpg 360w,\n/static/cf2e5f163fad4cc35dea765394af52a5/20801/plugins-everywhere.jpg 720w,\n/static/cf2e5f163fad4cc35dea765394af52a5/64a54/plugins-everywhere.jpg 735w\"\n            sizes=\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\"\n            type=\"image/jpeg\"\n          />\n          <img\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n            src=\"/static/cf2e5f163fad4cc35dea765394af52a5/20801/plugins-everywhere.jpg\"\n            alt=\"Plugins everywhere meme\"\n            title=\"Plugins everywhere meme\"\n            loading=\"lazy\"\n            decoding=\"async\"\n            style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n          />\n        </picture>\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>If you analyze your entire tech stack, you will surprised how many of them support writing plugins. From your database to your CI provider. From Kubernetes to Docker. From Figma to a Raspberry pi.</p>\n<p>And if any of these products are open source, you can do more than just extending them. You can technically change them from their very core.</p>\n<p>But why is that? Why did iPhones kicked the Motorola-s out of the market? Why would someone prefer a platform where they have to do extra work themselves over choosing an all-inclusive but closed product? The answer varies subjectively with people. To me, it’s the power that comes with open collaboration. You get more people building great things and sharing with each other, beyond the boundaries of a company or an org. Luckily open source has taught us similar lessons in the past 30 years.</p>\n<p>To sum it up, there is no one-size-fits-all solution for developers. They love the unique culture in their teams and cherish them.</p>\n<h2>Why do developers prefer Backstage over other IDP platforms?</h2>\n<p>If you don’t already know about <a href=\"https://backstage.io\">Backstage</a>, it’s an open platform for building developer portals in your company. It’s an open source project incubating at CNCF.</p>\n<p>An <a href=\"https://internaldeveloperplatform.org/what-is-an-internal-developer-platform/#developer-portal-service-catalog-ui-api-or-cli\">internal developer portal</a> is something that looks different at each company and has different use-cases. For some, it’s the developer's go-to hub for anything and everything. For some, it’s their entire catalog of the internal software ecosystem. For some, it’s their place to read and explore technical documentation. Or a place to launch new software components in the company. And many, many more such use cases.</p>\n<p>Spotify has over 200 plugins inside their Backstage instance to enable additional use cases like A/B testing, user management, inner source, data pipelines, monitoring, deployment tracker and so on.</p>\n<p>All these Backstage plugins inside a company are not built by their core maintainers team - it is federated and built by the experts in their domain. And it kind of makes sense. The ML/AI folks should decide and build what the rest of ML/AL engineers in the company should be using. The data folks should design the data hub and not those three full stack engineers maintaining the portal. The <a href=\"https://backstage.io/plugins\">Open Source marketplace</a> for Backstage has hundreds of plugins built by different companies.</p>\n<p>Moreover, these plugins inside your Backstage-powered developer portal not only come from open source, but you have full power to write your own ones. Do you have an in-house way of managing users? No worries, write that plugin. Do you have an in-house way to measure software performance metrics? No worries, write that plugin.</p>\n<p>After all, Backstage is your developer portal. Why not bend it to fit your existing engineering culture, rather than changing your culture to fit how a software works.</p>","timeToRead":3}},{"node":{"id":"d2a49765-3734-5727-afbd-8f11b695fe94","frontmatter":{"categories":["Non-Tech"],"date":"Jul 2021","draft":false,"slug":"/blog/huxleys-world-of-perceptions","subtitle":"What we ordinarily call reality, is merely that slice of total fact which our biological equipment, our linguistic heritage and our social conventions of thought and feeling make it possible for us to apprehend.","summary":"What we ordinarily call reality, is merely that slice of total fact which our biological equipment, our linguistic heritage and our social conventions of thought and feeling make it possible for us to apprehend.","title":"Aldous Huxley's world of perceptions"},"html":"<p>You may already know of this novel called 1984, and its author George Orwell. Aldous Huxley wrote a dystopian classic called Brave New World, which is contemporary to 1984 and has a similar literary significance. Although Huxley is slightly less familiar, I have come to realize.</p>\n<p>Both Huxley and Orwell talked about dyspotian futures. Although the path leading up to their fearful vision of world were treaded from different ends.</p>\n<p>\"What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no-one who wanted to read one.\"</p>\n<p>\"Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egotism.\"</p>\n<p>\"In 1984, people are controlled by inflicting pain. In Brave New World, they are controlled by inflicting pleasure.\", writes Neil Postman.</p>\n<p>Reading this with the context of Social Media and News in our present world, we are so much closer to the world Huxley envisioned almost hundred years ago.</p>\n<p>However, this blog post isn't about dystopia. I want to talk a bit about this other masterpiece Huxley wrote called \"The Doors of Perception\". It is a tiny book, just about 30 pages; but is top shelf for me.</p>\n<h2>The Doors of Perception</h2>\n<p>Huxley says that no two human beings have the same perception of the world. We perceive things around us uniquely. For example, it doesn't matter how close we feel to a person, let it be our partner, a close friend of ours or our parents - each of our perceptions will always be different. And it gets interesting if you think more about it.</p>\n<p>\"We live together, we act on, and react to, one another; but always and in all circumstances we are\nby ourselves. The martyrs go hand in hand into the arena; they are crucified alone. Embraced, the lovers desperately try to fuse their insulated ecstasies into a single self-transcendence; in vain. By its very nature every embodied spirit is doomed to suffer and enjoy in solitude. Sensations, feelings, insights, fancies - all these are private and, except through symbols and at second hand, incommunicable. We can pool information about experiences, but never the experiences themselves. From family to nation, every human group is a society of island universes...\", says Huxley in this book.</p>\n<h2>Reality</h2>\n<p>If someone asks me - what do you mean by reality? I'll say, well, you know the trees grow, flowers bloom, we live on planet Earth, which is round, human beings experience pain and suffering, gravity exists - and the other things that I see in the world.</p>\n<p>In my answer, I only mentioned what is easy for me to say, and can be agreed upon by a lot of people - hopefully everyone. But my complete reality is much larger and has edges which get a bit fuzzier. And I have not grown enough to describe them well, I think. I probably never will.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"What we ordinarily call \"reality\" is merely that slice of total fact which our biological equipment, our linguistic heritage and our social conventions of thought and feeling make it possible for us to apprehend.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These words of Huxley are painful to read at times. He basically suggests that we'll never know the <em>absolute reality</em> even if it exists. The tool that helps us cut this \"slice\" is called Perception.</p>\n<p>But the good news is that our perceptions change, or rather expand. And we get to see more of it as we grow.</p>\n<h2>Experiences</h2>\n<p>Huxley says that for each of us, there are many perceptions which we can not access. Their doors are locked for us. For example, if you never given birth, you can still talk about parenting but there is so much more still locked for you. And you'll get to unlock that <em>door</em> only when you will raise a child.</p>\n<p>He says that we are caged inside our perceptions, and that there are doors which lead us to new realities. But so far we have opened only a handful of them. And majority of doors are still locked for us - and that too from outside - so it's not possible for us to go and see what's on the other side merely by <em>thinking</em>.</p>\n<p>It takes experiences - or rather \"meaningful experiences\" to unlock these doors.</p>\n<h2>Communication</h2>\n<p>My university campus was beautiful. The trees and the shades of green always blew my mind. Taking frequent walks in the day was one of my favorite activities. For a few years, I thought everyone around me knew it - just because it was obvious for me.</p>\n<p>After reading Huxley and The Doors of Perception, I entered a brief but gloomy phase in life. He basically gave me some uncomfortable realizations that I had to live with. No matter how much I love my parents or my partner, they will never get to know it all. A part of me was getting sadder with more experiences I was having one by one. And it was getting harder for me to communicate <em>everything</em> I felt. I was naive.</p>\n<p>Years have passed and I have made peace with this limitation of life. We can not communicate everything, but we can try! Since then, I started putting more effort into the ways I communicate. Sometimes I speak, write poems, draw analogies from stories - and sometimes I would just send someone a song. I have made peace with the fact that everything can not be conveyed with language. Some things need to be heard, seen and felt.</p>\n<p>Same goes for taking pictures. Don't get me wrong - I think photos are a great way of communicating. But sometimes I respect a view, by not taking a picture. How would you feel if someone took a favorite song of yours, and sang it poorly and offbeat? The same goes for me when I try to capture extraordinary beauty of nature in pixels. It usually happens with mountains, forests, oceans, etc.</p>\n<h2>Art is an attempt to communicate</h2>\n<p>Art (poetry, music, paintings etc.) are beautiful attempts by human beings to convey their perceptions. Even though I will never get to think about music, the way David Gilmour of Pink Floyd did. I will never get to think about world, the way Aldous Huxley did. I will never look at the stars in the sky, the way Van Gogh did. But their music, writings and paintings hints me of a larger reality.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Realizing that the true nature of reality is beyond our comprehension and that we'll always be cutting slices of it, can be a humbling feeling. It can inspire us to keep expanding our perceptions - by have more meaningful experiences in life.</p>","timeToRead":4}},{"node":{"id":"4963037f-04cb-58ef-97d6-c862e2225448","frontmatter":{"categories":["Tech"],"date":"Dec 2020","draft":false,"slug":"/blog/why-do-open-source-in-college","subtitle":"If you are planning to stay close to Software after graduation, this article might win you over to do Open Source.","summary":"If you are planning to stay close to Software after graduation, this article might win you over to do Open Source.","title":"Why should one do Open Source in college?"},"html":"<blockquote>\n<p>If you are planning to stay close to Software after graduation, this article might win you over to do Open Source.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>More and more students are now being involved with Open Source programming. Thanks to programs like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code\">Google Summer of Code</a> who have seriously changed the lives of many and introduced hundreds of thousands of young students to Open Source programming.</p>\n<p>However, this number is small in the grand scheme of things.</p>\n<p>If I have to make a guess, out of all the students who graduate and start their career around Software (including Data Science, Machine Learning, etc.), less than 10% would ever contribute to any Open Source projects. And even less would do so for an extended period of time.</p>\n<p>In this blog post, I am writing down some reflections. I am highlighting few major reasons why I feel open source contributions are helpful. And the benefits are extraordinary.</p>\n<h2>You learn so much more</h2>\n<p>Almost all of your Pull Requests will be reviewed by other people. In a healthy open source community, maintainers spend a big chunk of their time reviewing incoming Pull Requests. There are many times when review comments leave me in awe - and I am filled with gratitude. The reviewer wants to have good quality code in the software, but in effect of that, you learn so much more from their insights and experience.</p>\n<p>Ideally, this is one of the those experiences you may get in your internships and first few jobs. But what are the chances of you ending up in such a team? And even if you get one helpful mentor, that's just one. If you stay in Open Source communities, you are constantly learning from numerous of those, and not just in summer for a period of three months.</p>\n<p>Our ways of doing software are heavily biased on the first projects we get involved with. We copy over the ideas to the future, since we know they have worked well. Exposure to multiple Open Source projects break that bias, and exposes us to other newer ways of creating Software.</p>\n<p>I have seen many issues on GitHub describing a problem that seems extremely hard to solve. And when GitHub says, <em>this issue got closed by this specific Pull Request</em> - I feel spoiled that I get to see what that Pull Request did. To have public access to such knowledge is a gift to this community.</p>\n<p>Not everyone studies Computer Science in college. And even if they do, their Software Engineering courses are either missing or outdated to the current day and age. MIT launched a course called - <a href=\"https://missing.csail.mit.edu/\">\"The Missing Semester of Your CS Education\"</a> to address this problem. Computer Science and Software Engineering have grown so much now, that it's impossible to teach both of them in a single curriculum. And the subjects have diverged - It has become Theory vs Practicality, Research vs Industry. Not all but most CS Professors are much closer to the research than the industry, and they expect students to do Open Source projects and internships on their own to gain the industry experience.</p>\n<p>Last but not least, a vast majority of Open Source work is done remote, over the internet, with strangers. The skills required to carry on a remote work become fundamental necessities - good written communication is one of many.</p>\n<h2>You escape the privilege barrier</h2>\n<p>In India, more than a million students graduate engineering courses <em>every year</em>. Every other job extended in my college placement season was somehow related to programming. This number gets higher with the several tiers of colleges. I imagine an average good Software Company would get a headcount of 10 new-grad engineers, to hire from the world.</p>\n<p>These numbers break my heart. Not everyone gets the chance to experience joy and growth in their career.</p>\n<p>Open Source is small but a beam of hope for these students. Google Summer of Code doesn't look at your IIT JEE rank for you to participate in it. Maintainers don't look at what Department or college you study in, before answering your questions. All these nonsensical privilege barriers do not exist in your way to improve yourself and learn.</p>\n<h2>You become a volunteer</h2>\n<p>Open Source contribution was my first exposure of volunteering and belongingness to a community. Not everything needs to be paid in money. I started seeing the return value in terms of learning, joy of accomplishing something, or just doing something together with people.</p>\n<p>I was part of a college group which helps college students learn more about Open Source. Looking back, I see that a lot of Open Source contributors follow the idea that - <em>Knowledge should be shared</em>. They start helping out people for no apparent reasons. Well mainly because someone else helped them in their journey and they want to continue the tradition.</p>\n<p>This feeling of volunteering (somewhat altruism) in Open Source still impresses me and others. The idea of non-monetary benefits in work is strange to a majority of people I have met professionally.</p>\n<h2>Toxic competitions are not for everyone</h2>\n<p>You might already know that college admission exams are highly competitive. One wants to get into the best college. One wants to study in the best department. One wants to score the highest grades. One wants to get Gold medals in the online competitive events.</p>\n<p>It easily gets toxic for some people. It changes the perception of their social life. Even when talking to friends, they think of things they know more of - due to their performances in previous competitions.</p>\n<p>I haven't seen that much competition when it comes to Open Source contributions. People help each other a lot more than trying to get ahead in some kind of race.</p>\n<h2>You might fall in love with Software</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman\">Richard Feynman</a> has said - <em>\"If you find science boring, you're learning it from a wrong teacher.\"</em></p>\n<p>I feel the same for programming. Students may not like the complexity of a doubly linked list written in C, but might enjoy Python's 10 lines of code for their web server. Sure a lot of people like writing Software, but not everyone <em>\"loves\"</em> to do it for their career.</p>\n<p>In contrast of only working with a handful of internship projects, working on many well designed Open Source software increase our chances of falling in love with it. And it helps.</p>\n<p><em>Thank you for reading! &#x3C;3</em></p>","timeToRead":4}},{"node":{"id":"88c5d1b3-a3d8-5504-a553-59be1222a6e3","frontmatter":{"categories":["Tech","Non-Tech"],"date":"Jun 2020","draft":false,"slug":"/blog/live-asynchronously","subtitle":"Bringing the philosophy of asynchronous programming into life.","summary":"Bringing the philosophy of asynchronous programming into life.","title":"Live Asynchronously"},"html":"<p>I first heard the phrase \"Live Asynchronously\" in <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/live-asynchronously-c8e7172fe7ea/\">this article</a> written by the amazing Quincy Larson, the creator of freecodecamp.org.</p>\n<p>In my last blog post about <a href=\"/blog/spotify/\">Joining Spotify in Sweden</a>, I wrote a bit about this. Here, I have written more about what living asynchronously means to me. I have put some concrete examples from life where I have used this philosophy.</p>\n<h2>Define Asynchronous</h2>\n<p>I have understood Asynchronous in programming but <a href=\"%5Bhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchrony%5D(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchrony)\">Asynchrony</a> has more (similiar) meanings.</p>\n<p>In my earliest days with Javascript, I remember being stuck one time. In my program I was doing an API request. Irrespective of whether the request was successful, my variable to store the API response was always <code class=\"language-text\">undefined</code>. I was in my first year of college and I expressed my frustration to my brother with <em>\"Javascript sucks\"</em>. All he said was <em>\"Remember, Javascript is asynchronous.\"</em> And that fixed the issue! I still see such problems and they get fixed by the <em>Remember...</em></p>\n<p>Most of the beginners face this problem with Javascript in their early days because Javascript is async in nature. This is unlike Python, which is a imperative (procedural) language.</p>\n<h3>Difference</h3>\n<p>Let us take this short example of a program to understand the difference.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">\n1. Say \"Hello World\".\n2. *API request to fetch an image from the internet.\n3. Based on the response of the request, store the image.\n4. Calculate 1 + 1.\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>In a procedural language like Python or C/C++, all the 4 lines will be executed one after the other. The lines 3 and 4 will be executed only when line 2 has completely finished (network request has completed). But, it could take a second or more to complete that request.</p>\n<p>Our program will spend most of its time at line 2 waiting for the network request to finish.</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>But, in an asynchronous language like Javascript, we will write the program differently.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">\n1. Say \"Hello World\".\n2. *API request to fetch an image from the internet.\n3.              (Callback) Based on the response of the network request, store the image.\n4. Calculate 1 + 1.\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Here, line 1 will be executed as usual. In line 2, we will do the API request. But, this time we are not going to wait around for the response. We will immediately move on to Line 4 and execute it. When the network call in line 2 finishes, we will execute the \"callback\" assigned to it in line 3.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p><strong>Asynchronous programming comes into the picture for the blocks of code which take significant time to execute i.e. something which blocks the procedural execution of the main program.</strong></p>\n<p>Sending an internet request, reading/writing to a file or a database takes way more time than calculating 1 + 1. So, we write a \"callback function\" for our asynchronous block of code. The callback decides what to do when the network request or the I/O operation completes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise\">Promise in Javascript</a> has the same philosophy and is more powerful than callbacks.</p>\n<h2>The Philosophy</h2>\n<p>Humans and computers function in an extraordinarily similar fashion. The I/O (Input/Output) operation for a computer is to talk to other computers. The I/O operation for us is to talk to other people.</p>\n<p>This blocks the main program. It means there is a chunk of time that it takes away from the main program for as long as the blocking execution is being done.</p>\n<p>These I/O operations are necessary for us to survive and communicate. They happen frequently and are also time-consuming. It then becomes important for us to manage them well.</p>\n<p><strong>Living Asynchronously is us making sure our I/O operations are asynchronous most of the time.</strong></p>\n<h2>Applying the philosophy</h2>\n<h3>Year 2004 Age 7</h3>\n<p>I remember in my school, our Maths textbooks used to have many questions in the form of exercises. An exercise was a collection of questions on one topic. There used to be dozens of chapters and hundreds of exercises in a book. The year-long school curriculum and timeline were to make sure all the chapters and their exercises get completed by the students.</p>\n<p>Generally, the entire batch of students is synchronised on what exercise they are doing. Let's say the teacher decides that this week, we are going to complete the Exercise 21 based on the basic Trigonometric formulae. By Monday next week, It is expected of the students to have their notebooks up-to-date. That's how synchronous programming works.</p>\n<p>This model is not great. Not everyone in the class needs to follow the pace set by the teacher for what they deem is suitable for the class.</p>\n<p>When I was in the 3rd standard (age 7), my father started teaching Maths to my elder brother and me. (Fun fact: All three of us now do programming for a living!). It was 2004. In the summer before the school would begin, dad had set the target for me to solve all the problems in the book I was going to study that year. I loved the experience! Although it took a lot of time from my summer vacation, it was rewarding. And I didn't want to stop there. Dad noticed this and bought me the maths textbooks for the following years. And this went on until in the 7th standard, I was doing the problems of the Maths book used in the 10th class.</p>\n<p>If I had followed the synchronous philosophy of the school, I would have to sit around throughout the year, learning not much new. A decade after that time, I would consciously start living asynchronously.</p>\n<h3>Working in college societies</h3>\n<p>Back in college, for five years I was part of a <a href=\"https://wiki.metakgp.org/w/Technology_Literary_Society\">literary society</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kossiitkgp\">a club</a> to promote open source. These were two separate groups and I was an active member of both! In my 3rd/4th year, I was part of the so called \"executive batch\". We were 4-5 people responsible to execute the events organized by 30-50 of us members, for the hundreds of students on campus to attend.</p>\n<p>Before we organized any event (a poetry night, an open mic, a Python or a GSoC workshop, etc.), I as the organizer needed to sync with all the members helping out. There are many operations that need to be taken care of, like logistics, publicity, poster distribution, members' performances/talks, communication with external members, finances, etc. If I remember correctly, I had burnt out early in the year. I had to sync with so many people during the days of the actual event. I valued the event's success not much by its attendance, but a lot by how we did it and the things we learned in the process.</p>\n<p>Lets take the task of poster distribution. The job was to print a bunch of posters for the event that had its details, description, contact, venue, time, etc. and paste it across the college campus so that other students would notice. From the team, I would assign one person to take care of this. This meant that they were responsible for going to the printing press, getting the copies done, and then with the help of other members, putting them up across the campus. Given I had other equally important tasks to take care of, it was a nightmare to contact all the people involved in this particular task. But, I couldn't just \"assign and forget\" the task to someone because, if he or she decided to slack off, it would disrupt the event. This has happened quite many times as I remember. So, I started identifying people I could trust, who shared the passion of the work and cared. And then, living asynchronously was easy and the only sane way to go about it.</p>\n<p><em>Then on, all my instructions and tasks had their <em>callbacks</em>. And if someone else asked me to do something, I would ask them to write their <em>callback</em> i.e. tell me what to do when I'm done with this. I reduced many unnecessary \"blocking\" I/O operations from my life, resulting in a much relaxed life.</em></p>\n<h3>WhatsApp message \"seen\" tick</h3>\n<p>Many years ago Facebook started showing things like \"message seen at 10:10 AM\" in their chatbox. This was the first time I saw something like this. Earlier, messaging someone was much like sending a very short email - you didn't expect a response within a minute. Instant communication started catching up and now there is a product called \"mail tracker\" which tells you when and how many times your email was read.</p>\n<p>I have disabled the blue seen tick in WhatsApp and I have a <a href=\"/blog/delete-facebook/\">dummy facebook account</a>. This means, I don't get to know when my message was read and the other person doesn't know when I read their message. This is me, trying to reduce \"synchronous\" communication from life, as it introduces more problems than it solves.</p>\n<p>If someone <em>sees</em> my message, I never ought to expect an instant response. I have no idea what they are doing in their \"main program\". They could be in a thought process, talking with someone else, working on something, or be in one of a thousand different possibilities. So \"seen at 10:10 AM\" gives me no information. It instead triggers me to think - <em>why have they not replied yet</em>.</p>\n<p>If I want to have a synchronous conversation, I would set up a call at the convenience of both of us. That is much efficient in every aspect. By not having to worry about replying instantly and not expecting someone to do so, I have freed a lot of time that I used to waste in waiting for the response.</p>\n<h3>Relationships and Behaviour</h3>\n<p>If I have the freedom of my thoughts, asynchrony is associated with freedom.</p>\n<p>If our actions and words demand synchronous response from the other person, it directly impacts their time. It affects how they want to spend it. Doing it way often is not nice. And it is a kind gesture to respect their time and do less synchronous communication. Allowing someone to be free is a great expression of love and it makes us better humans.</p>\n<p>I would be crazy to say that all synchronous communications are bad. That would be insane. What I do is reduce the frequency, and increase the time to generate more value. And of course, do lots of async stuff. :)</p>\n<h3>Blog post vs Notifications</h3>\n<p>A blog post is a shining example of communicating asynchronously in this world.</p>\n<p>This blog post does not demand anything from you. You can close it as soon as you opened it, read it now, a week later or next year. I have no expectation of knowing whether you read it or not, unless you want to let me know. I enjoy writing and reading them. They do not feel \"instant\". They do not say \"just now\" or \"posted a minute ago\". As Quincy Larson says - all notifications are synchronous. Social media wants to notify me if someone has said something publicly. Facebook/Instagram/Twitter wants to keep me in \"sync\" with what all my friends are doing. However, this blog post will sit here on this website. And if someone wants to see if I have written something new, it will be discovered.</p>\n<p>Ironically, I <em>am</em> going to tweet a link to this blog post. That will be synchronous. Oh, the hippocracy! ;)</p>\n<h3>Remote work promotes living asynchronously</h3>\n<p>Before my first job started, I was convinced that by introducing more asynchrony in life, I am saving my time and energy and I am being happier. When I started working, I had the challenge of adopting the same philosophy at work. I knew it would be challenging because people have their own style of working. But I tried my best to keep this philosophy alive with me.</p>\n<p>If I would have technical queries to ask, most of them would be Email or Slack and few in-person. As I understood the team and the technologies better over time, I would change all my questions to being asynchronous. That kept everyone involved a bit happier. The person who'd write the answer, would do so in their free time. Hence the responses had more details and helped me more than what a disrupting synchronous question would have done.</p>\n<p>When a project is newborn, synchronous communication between the stakeholders and engineers is necessary and valuable. They help avoid confusion and misunderstandings. But as the tasks start being granular, sync-meetings begin losing their value.</p>\n<p>If a project has grown large and has no documentation, there is no way asynchronous communication is possible even after months or years. The few people who created it, are going to waste more time answering questions, which they should have written in the form of documentation ages ago.</p>\n<p>Generally, product managers love to talk about projects in team meetings. Why won't they? They have a vision and want to share. But a wise engineering manager would come and ask, \"Can this information be shared via an email?\". This is a smart question to ask each time because it not only promotes written documentation but saves time for the involved engineers. They got time to focus and pay more attention to the work, which would have been disrupted by a synchronous meeting.</p>\n<p>Similar to blog posts, Documentation of projects and code is a light beam of hope in the asynchronous life. If I can find the documentation to read, it drastically reduces the amount of synchronous communication involved to solve my problem. And since a tap on the shoulder in not possible when working remotely, more written communication is the way to go!</p>\n<h3>TLDR (Too long, didn't read)</h3>\n<p>Living Asynchronously is inspired by the concept of asynchronous programming and Javascript's callbacks and promises. Synchronous life events are blocking in nature, are inefficient and time-consuming. It is not always possible, but living asynchronous life has its benefits and is a great way to live.</p>\n<p>I believe this philosophy is easy to understand and can be applied on many aspects of life. I encourage you to think on your own and identify the synchronous events in life. And then imagine how living asynchronously would feel.</p>","timeToRead":10}},{"node":{"id":"f9b08919-1926-5365-ba16-9756ddfdad25","frontmatter":{"categories":["Tech"],"date":"May 2020","draft":false,"slug":"/blog/spotify","subtitle":"Thoughts on Japan, my principles of work and what lies ahead.","summary":"I have written about living in Japan, my work principles and what lies ahead.","title":"Joining Spotify in Sweden"},"html":"<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 720px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 30%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAGCAYAAADDl76dAAAACXBIWXMAAC4jAAAuIwF4pT92AAAA0UlEQVQY033Qv0qCYRgF8F/SUFOjNPfnEgQHFwdrK3CKLiArhELBRYUIvAOhlpAgUCK6Abemlpps6BaaShCiofjwKRy+PNPDc95znvMepmjhA1+4wrJ0ZPyPP+4II/RxhzdcBldAMUW8gA3ksIu1WfIJXVRQwyme49EFjnEQ+0R8iAZuIswjTrCFfGL4giGaaGOAMVaxh3vchuFDHOhFiA7OQpdUtZgYVvGNd7ziE9eRvoQdnGMf2Tiyju2oZBN1lGe/3YjuJtHfUkpn87DyO/0A/AEoMwETdC4AAAAASUVORK5CYII='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n          <source\n              srcset=\"/static/c97391051b6b4cbe34d7a1bfe040d88d/7c297/spotify.webp 180w,\n/static/c97391051b6b4cbe34d7a1bfe040d88d/33ecc/spotify.webp 360w,\n/static/c97391051b6b4cbe34d7a1bfe040d88d/df77d/spotify.webp 720w,\n/static/c97391051b6b4cbe34d7a1bfe040d88d/5c666/spotify.webp 1080w,\n/static/c97391051b6b4cbe34d7a1bfe040d88d/95f20/spotify.webp 1440w,\n/static/c97391051b6b4cbe34d7a1bfe040d88d/5d4cc/spotify.webp 2362w\"\n              sizes=\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\"\n              type=\"image/webp\"\n            />\n          <source\n            srcset=\"/static/c97391051b6b4cbe34d7a1bfe040d88d/e9ea2/spotify.png 180w,\n/static/c97391051b6b4cbe34d7a1bfe040d88d/53918/spotify.png 360w,\n/static/c97391051b6b4cbe34d7a1bfe040d88d/242a6/spotify.png 720w,\n/static/c97391051b6b4cbe34d7a1bfe040d88d/b4ad3/spotify.png 1080w,\n/static/c97391051b6b4cbe34d7a1bfe040d88d/89066/spotify.png 1440w,\n/static/c97391051b6b4cbe34d7a1bfe040d88d/e1cb3/spotify.png 2362w\"\n            sizes=\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\"\n            type=\"image/png\"\n          />\n          <img\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n            src=\"/static/c97391051b6b4cbe34d7a1bfe040d88d/242a6/spotify.png\"\n            alt=\"spotify\"\n            title=\"spotify\"\n            loading=\"lazy\"\n            decoding=\"async\"\n            style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n          />\n        </picture>\n    </span>\n<a href=\"https://newsroom.spotify.com/media-kit/logo-and-brand-assets/\"><em>Image source</em></a></p>\n<h2>Life in Japan</h2>\n<p>All the things that I knew about Japan turned out to be true, as soon as I arrived here 8 months ago.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Japan is a <strong>beautiful</strong> place to live! The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry_blossom\">cherry blossoms</a> season just started. There is a lot of nature surrounding downtown Tokyo. I haven't experienced the peak of summer here yet, but the cold climate has been cherry on top of it all.</p>\n<p>I spent five years in my college campus where you could spot trees from anywhere (my hostel room, classrooms and the roads). Having all this nature around me once again was a relief.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Most <strong>people are mindful, quiet and private</strong>. This is great for those who want to live a private life. I believe my friends and I used to be the only ones talking in the entire freaking train.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Delicacies</strong>! I don't remember having a bad meal ever. The proportion size and the amount of calories are thoughtfully decided. The meals are prioritized to be healthy <em>and</em> tasty. This is not true for many countries.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Japan is very <strong>safe</strong>. I know many of my friends never locked their apartments before going out (bad idea). Walking outside late at nights does not feel threatening. I am raised to be careful about incoming traffic and being stoic about what could go wrong. Certainly, I have never had any bad experience. I didn't encounter any homeless people either.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The city is mostly clean. People do not enter anyone's house with their shoes on. There is almost zero vandalism.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <strong>customer service</strong> can not be imagined and replicated easily in other societies of the world. I know and have heard that people in India are very helpful. I felt people in Japan sometimes do <em>beyond normal</em> things for their customers. People take their jobs very seriously. The entire bank staff greets you when you come in. You will not be left unattended even for a minute. And everyone will say Thank you and keep bowing until you get out of the door and disappear. My God, I used to feel bad.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The not-so-good things that I had heard are also true!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Language barrier</p>\n<p>You can get by in Tokyo if you don't know Japanese and have friends whom you can talk to. But my life was of a <em>tourist</em> and was limited in social terms. Essential shopping (groceries, etc.) becomes limited. I have to show an image and hope that the person can recognize what I am asking for. Using a public service e.g. Hospitals, courier service is hard. I can not enquire what I want to. Google Translate is barely helpful, and is useless most of the times.</p>\n<p>Many people learn Japanese after coming here. They see a life here and want to settle. As of now, I know I only want to <em>settle</em> in India and maybe in an English speaking country. My work required no Japanese, hence I did not learn. Instead I invested my time in learning new paradigms of programming in a large company. I feel I made the right decision and learnt a lot.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Rush hour traffic</p>\n<p>You need courage to commute in the morning. Even if I wanted to start my day early, it is not going to happen. Trains are packed at more than 200% of their capacity between 7-9 AM. I won't need to hold any bars in the moving trains because maybe five people would be pushing me from all directions. Lo and behold the laws of physics, I won't fall or even move when the train accelerated. xD</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Principles of work</h2>\n<p><em>Things I learnt in my first job</em></p>\n<h3>Living asynchronously</h3>\n<p>Three years ago, I read this blog post by Quincy Larson, the founder of freecodecamp.org, titled <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/live-asynchronously-c8e7172fe7ea/\">Live asynchronously.</a>. I got inspired by it. I took the concepts of Promises and callbacks in Javascript on a philosophical level.</p>\n<p>Working Synchronously is the easy option. Async is hard to code and to practice in real life.</p>\n<p>Living async means writing negligible number of messages/emails which require you to constantly wait until there is response. They block you from continuing to work on something else. Living async means lesser number of unimportant meetings and sync ups. In fact, when I used to be stuck in the beginning, I used to write my doubts as long expressive messages and would not expect a response immediately. I think I learnt this from the Open Source communities. ;)</p>\n<p><em>Edit: Some folks asked me on twitter to elaborate on this, so I wrote a follow up blog post about <a href=\"https://orkohunter.net/blog/live-asynchronously/\">living asynchronously</a>.</em></p>\n<h3>Working concurrently</h3>\n<p>I always took two or more concurrent (independent) tasks at the same time. If I get blocked or maybe bored with the first task, I would switch to the second one and would wait until I get unblocked. It is not feasible when the first task is huge. But even then, it can be broken down into chunks of concurrent pieces. And then, I would \"parallelly process\" them on my end.</p>\n<h3>Writing daily notes</h3>\n<p>I used to take notes aggressively when I started working. I would write more than 100 words each day. I would publish them on an internal Confluence space.</p>\n<p>The main reasons for doing this were -</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>We forget</strong>. The meetings with our managers, mentors and coworkers in our first month are crucial. They convey some of the most important things about the company, team, project, etc. It was important for me to write <em>all</em> of it down.</li>\n<li><strong>Self review</strong>. At the end of the day, I would go through my notes and publish a summary of things I did, things I learnt, etc. It would take 10 minutes each day. My quarterly self reviews used to be very very long and exhaustive, since I had the logs of what I did. After six months, I changed the frequency of publishing the logs to weekly, but I would still take daily private notes.</li>\n<li><strong>Being public</strong>. My page was easily accessible by visiting <code class=\"language-text\">go/himanshu</code> from inside the company. I loved that I was being transparent about how I am spending my time in the company. And it also helped my indirect co-workers to know what I do here.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Docs, docs. code. docs. docs. Technical specs.</h3>\n<p>Working on code without documentation is not fun. You are surprised each time you add a new feature. You have low confidence when making changes. For the love of humanity, document your decisions and the architecture.</p>\n<h3>Integration tests</h3>\n<p>Unit tests are great. But I love end to end integration tests a lot. They give me more confidence that the functionality will not break with my PRs being merged. I couldn't resist writing an integration test for the project I was working on. <a href=\"https://natooktesting.wordpress.com/2017/08/24/x-unit-tests-0-integration-tests/\">You might have seen some gifs about X unit tests and 0 integration tests.</a></p>\n<h3>No unconstructive criticism</h3>\n<p>When we join a new place, we notice hundreds of things that can be done better (according to us). If I go on complaining about all, and do not offer to fix any, I am being unhelpful. So, I did not offer any unnecessary feedback or criticism unless they were constructive.\nThis is the Chapter 1 of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Win_Friends_and_Influence_People\">How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie</a>.</p>\n<h3>Scoping a project, breaking down into smaller tasks</h3>\n<p>A good engineer is supposed to see the bigger picture of a project. They collaborate hand in hand with Product managers and help in writing the Spec. They break the project into smaller tasks which help them correctly estimate the timeline. They offer creative solutions which the PM might not be aware of.\nThis skill comes with experience and time spent in the company and is valued by everyone around.</p>\n<h2>Next steps with Spotify</h2>\n<p>In a few months, I will relocate to Stockholm, Sweden. Hopefully, the travel is permitted by then. My work will be related to Spotify's newly open sourced project called <a href=\"https://github.com/spotify/backstage\">Backstage</a>. Spotify has been developing this for four years and has now decided to open source it, to simplify the infrastructure complexity in companies. Check it out, you'll find it interesting. <a href=\"https://backstage.io/\">backstage.io</a></p>\n<p>I am personally very excited that I will get to work closely with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/decause/\">Remy Decausemaker</a> again. Remy was my direct manager at Twitter. He now leads the Open Source program at Spotify. I have learnt so much about Open Source in the time that I have worked with him and I feel blessed that there lies more. :)</p>\n<p>As far as I know from Spotify engineering blogs and the people, it has a strong engineering culture. Teams (Squads) have autonomy of the work they do. People share knowledge and support collaboration and individual growth. I intend to stay in the company for long and hopefully I come out as a much better engineer.</p>\n<p>Plus, Spotify is a product that I have been using for many years.

Checking and fixing code style is something that can be automated.\nHence, it must be!</p>\n<p>I made the first commit in December 2016. I was in my third year of college. In my first two summer breaks,\nI had been contributing to Open Source projects in Python,\nmainly because of the Google Summer of Code program. And in a few months, I was about to be a GSoC mentor,\nwhich meant doing code reviews.\nPEP8Speaks came alive out of my personal need.</p>\n<h1>Users and adoption 📈</h1>\n<p>Creating and maintaining the project was not the hardest part. After the initial few months, I rant out of all my ideas.\nSo, the development slowed down. Hence I wanted other projects to start using it.</p>\n<p>More users meant a lot of things.\nI got to work on new features, optimizations, security, etc. Being very young in my career, meant\nthis was a wonderful way to do Software development.</p>\n<p><strong>PEP8Speaks is useful for an open source project which has many contributors i.e. organizations</strong>.\nIt is not very helpful if you are the only\none working on your project. Hence most of the time, if someone finds it useful, they have to convince all the maintainers\nin their organization to start using it.</p>\n<p>Larger orgs are more hesitant in adding new things as a requirement or dependency because they are worried that it\nwould not work properly.\nHence, I needed to <strong>build trust in the project</strong>.</p>\n<h2>Growth efforts</h2>\n<p>In short, organic growth requires me to do the following -</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Being open for feature requests.</strong></p>\n<p>Many cool features in PEP8Speaks are not my original ideas, but recommendations from the community.</p>\n<p>Developers rarely want\nto change the way they work. Instead, they love bending (customizing) the tools they use.</p>\n<p><em>If only PEP8Speaks were to support this new feature A,</em>\n<em>if only PEP8Speaks supported this feature B,</em>\n<em>...we would love to adopt it!</em></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Implementing feature requests.</strong></p>\n<p>One way of gaining trust in the community is to listen to the issues and incoming Pull Requests. These users helped\na lot in spreading the word.</p>\n<p>And so, I need to address all the feature requests.\nBut it is also limited by the time I have. So, I need to pick among those requests.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Having a helpful README</strong></p>\n<p>Every knowledge required to install and customize PEP8Speaks has to be on the README. And also, in a visually discoverable way.\nHaving a <em>kickass</em> README is a must.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Spreading the word at the right places</strong></p>\n<p>I was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tcJi378B2M\">a speaker at the SciPy 2017 conference</a> in Austin.\nIn the lightning talks session, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtgiYrf2bv8\">I talked about PEP8Speaks</a>.\nThe ballroom had close to a thousand Python developers. (SciPy conference is a yearly \"pilgrimage\" in the Scientific Python world.)</p>\n<p>And this is the reason, a lot of PEP8Speaks users include scientific Python projects.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>PEP8Speaks bot has commented on <a href=\"https://github.com/search?o=desc&#x26;q=commenter%3Apep8speaks&#x26;s=&#x26;type=Issues\">around 17,000 pull requests</a>.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Most popular users</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Logo</th>\n<th>Organization</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/21206976?v=4&#x26;s=100\" alt=\"\"></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas\">Pandas</a></td>\n<td>Powerful data manipulation tools for Python</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/476009?v=4&#x26;s=100\" alt=\"\"></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://github.com/adobe\">Adobe</a></td>\n<td>Open source from Adobe</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/623819?v=4&#x26;s=100\" alt=\"\"></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://github.com/openSUSE\">openSUSE</a></td>\n<td>Linux distribution</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/58386951?v=4&#x26;s=100\" alt=\"\"></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning\">PyTorch Lightning</a></td>\n<td>The lightweight PyTorch wrapper for ML researchers.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1284191?v=4&#x26;s=100\" alt=\"\"></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://github.com/pydata/xarray\">xarray (PyData)</a></td>\n<td>N-D labeled arrays and datasets in Python (Python for Data)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/963197?s=100&#x26;v=4\" alt=\"\"></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://github.com/sunpy\">SunPy</a></td>\n<td>Python for Solar Physics</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/847984?v=3&#x26;s=100\" alt=\"\"></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://github.com/astropy\">Astropy</a></td>\n<td>Astronomy in Python</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/17349883?v=3&#x26;s=100\" alt=\"\"></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib\">Scikit Learn Contrib</a></td>\n<td>scikit-learn compatible projects</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/897180?s=100&#x26;v=4\" alt=\"\"></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://github.com/scikit-image\">Scikit Image</a></td>\n<td>Image processing in Python</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1284937?v=4&#x26;s=100\" alt=\"\"></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder\">Spyder IDE</a></td>\n<td>The Scientific Python Development Environment</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"\" alt=\"\"></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://github.com/NetworkX/NetworkX\">NetworkX</a></td>\n<td>Python library for graph theory and complex networks</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"\" alt=\"\"></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://github.com/statsmodels/statsmodels\">Statsmodels</a></td>\n<td>Statistical modeling and econometrics in Python</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<blockquote>\n<p>GitHub API allows me to find out all the users of the project.\nI keep the <a href=\"https://github.com/OrkoHunter/pep8speaks/wiki/List-of-users-and-orgs\">list of all organizations and users</a> on the public wiki.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>Sponsorship 💳</h1>\n<p>Even though the project is a free and open source software, it needs to be hosted on a server to work. The server receives around 3,000 API requests per minute.\nI deployed it on Heroku because it was free of cost.\nHeroku gave a limited number of hours per month for the servers to run. Within 1 year, the app started exhausting all the hours\nvery quickly. And then I had to pay for the server costs.</p>\n<p>In March 2019, I wrote a case to receive funding for the project. <a href=\"https://github.com/OrkoHunter/pep8speaks/wiki/Funding\">https://github.com/OrkoHunter/pep8speaks/wiki/Funding</a></p>\n<p>I <a href=\"https://github.com/OrkoHunter/pep8speaks/wiki/PSF-Grant-application\">wrote</a> to the PSF for the\n<a href=\"https://www.python.org/psf/grants/\">Python Software Foundation grant</a>.

I have a local setup with\nfew Jupyter Notebooks where I\ndo the debugging and I fix the problem for them. My main concern is that debugging PEP8Speaks is not straightforward.\nI want to make the development process smooth. This means the project can be maintained by more people, not one person.</p>\n<p>PEP8Speaks can be installed on public repositories with a few clicks, but running on private repositories is not trivial.\nI have written the <a href=\"https://github.com/OrkoHunter/pep8speaks/wiki/Instructions-to-deploy-a-fork\">instructions to do it</a>.\nThere are currently <a href=\"https://github.com/search?q=pep8speaks&#x26;type=Users\">9 private forks</a> of PEP8Speaks, that I know of.\nBut, I want to make it easier for private repositories to start using it. Just like\nrunning CircleCI or Codecov on private repos.</p>\n<p>The last most important thing in my mind is to improve the infrastructure. Write more developer-focused documentation, technical spec\nof the project and support new contributions.</p>\n<p>Cheers!</p>","timeToRead":6}},{"node":{"id":"61070536-f22e-56f1-a2c8-2f07184c95c8","frontmatter":{"categories":["Tech","Non-Tech"],"date":"Feb 2020","draft":false,"slug":"/blog/bfs-vs-dfs-in-friendships","subtitle":"In real life friendships, some prefer Breadth First Search, but some fancy Depth First Search","summary":"In real life friendships, some prefer Breadth First Search, but some fancy Depth First Search. BFS and DFS are two search methods in Computer Science.","title":"BFS vs DFS in friendships"},"html":"<p>If you already know and remember what <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search\">Breadth First Search (BFS)</a> and\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search\">Depth First Search (DFS)</a> are, skip to <strong>What are you saying?</strong></p>\n<p>Take my words with a grain of salt. I am mostly writing metaphors here.</p>\n<h2>Quick intro to BFS and DFS</h2>\n<p>In Graph Theory, we perform a search by traversing the graph. We start with one node and traverse the entire graph until we find what we are looking for.</p>\n<p>There are many ways to do that, but the two most popular ones are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search\">Breadth First Search (BFS)</a>\nand <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search\">Depth First Search (DFS)</a>. The name of the method is key to what do they do.</p>\n<p>In BFS, we search all the neighbour nodes first. And then search the 2nd-degree neighbours, then 3rd-degree, and so on. Here is a neat animation from Wikipedia for you.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/Animated_BFS.gif\" alt=\"BFS GIF\"></p>\n<p>But in DFS, we start with a neighbour and keep going in its branch as deep as we can, and then backtrack to a second neighbour and go deep into its branch, and so on.</p>\n<p>Read the wikipedia articles if you want to know more. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search\">BFS</a> &#x26; <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search\">DFS</a>.</p>\n<h2>What are you saying?</h2>\n<p>BFS and DFS can be seen among people as traits of how they make friends. Like introversion and extroversion, BFS and DFS are the characteristics of people's approach to <em>friendship</em>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>You might already have some idea by now. Take few seconds and draw a picture. Imagine two people (one doing BFS and other doing DFS)\nand think how they are different. It is fun to observe and ponder. :)</em></p>\n<p>College campus life is a perfect setting to spot both kinds of people.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>How are they different?</h2>\n<p>A person who is on the extreme end with <strong>BFS</strong> would generally have a larger number of friends and smaller number of acquaintances.\nThey constantly seek to convert their acquaintances into friends. They do not have any hard time making friends with someone.\nThey have a fear of missing out on creating new friendships as time slips by.</p>\n<p>A person who is on the other extreme with <strong>DFS</strong> would have a significant number of acquaintances but a smaller number of friends.\nThey would always be interested in taking their friendships on to the next level. They are NOT afraid of missing out on new friendships\nand want to work a lot on the existing ones.</p>\n<p><strong>BFS</strong> people can generate the same intensity in new friendships, as with their existing friends. They don't need much time for this.\nYet, most of the time BFS people are afraid to go deep into conversations with one friend. They would stop at one point.\nThey would fall out of conversations pretty easily. They wouldn't be interested in knowing more about their friends.\nThey would be certain they know enough about them.</p>\n<p><strong>DFS</strong> people never get bored with the friends they hangout with. They are willing to share deepest level of spiritual secrets\nwith each other. It takes a significant amount of time for their newer friendships to reach the intensity of their existing\nfriendships. They have strong perceptions, but loosely-held. They would cheer to look at things from other people's perceptions.</p>\n<p><em>Let me know if you can think of more differences.</em></p>\n<h2>Final words</h2>\n<p>Everyone has to do BFS first. In first year of college, you don't have enough nodes to do DFS with. So, you spend the first\n(and maybe second) year doing BFS. You join clubs, you hangout with your hostel-mates, and neighbours to create\n<a href=\"/blog/threads/\">threads</a>.</p>\n<p>After this, if you are a DFS person, your DFS mode will trigger. And it never stops.</p>\n<p>I do not have a dichotomous view on which is the right way of living. I believe one has to find the right balance.</p>\n<p><em>Thanks to <a href=\"https://nishnik.me\">Nishant Nikhil</a> for bringing this up, one fine evening back in college.</em></p>","timeToRead":3}},{"node":{"id":"fb50edb0-cca0-5aaf-88dc-bf07deaa8c2c","frontmatter":{"categories":["Non-Tech"],"date":"Apr 2019","draft":false,"slug":"/blog/letters","subtitle":"I made some of my letters and their responses public on my website.","summary":"I made some of my letters and their responses public on my website.","title":"Letters"},"html":"<h2>What did you do??</h2>\n<p>I have developed a habbit of writing letters to friends and family for the past few years.

I have included the complete correspondence in each case.</p>\n<p>All of the people involved in my correspondances have granted me the permission to publish them. One of them strongly encouraged me to do so, when I came up with this idea four months ago. I have removed all the names of people and places which could easily reveal their identity.

I made sure my actions do not affect it.</p>\n<p>I will keep updating the space <a href=\"/letters\">orkohunter.net/letters</a> based on my discretion.</p>\n<h2>Great! Why did you do it?</h2>\n<p><strong>1. Accountability</strong></p>\n<p>Writing letters is hard. It is a kind gesture from your side but it takes time to collect your thoughts and write them down in succinct words. I have spent from three hours to a few days on each letter. Hence, it is hard to keep writing even when I want to. The awareness that I have a public space on my website, will keep me accountable to update it and to write more.</p>\n<p><strong>2. It may inspire someone to write letters</strong></p>\n<p>I wish more people write letters. A letter can do wonders if you want to convey a message with impact. We choose texts to communicate daily. People forget messages sent over Facebook and Whatsapp. But people remember letters and often re-read them in future.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Some of the correspondences are so good that I want to share</strong></p>\n<p>Some letters along with their responses are thoughtful and fantastic read for me. I thought I should share them publicly. Read them as blog posts but in the form of a dialogue.</p>\n<h2>What do you think about letters?</h2>\n<p>Sometimes when I get any thought, I kill the urge to text, tweet or speak. I pick a pen and write it down. I think more on it, and when the content and the value increases, I write it as a letter and send it to someone, sometimes to multiple people.</p>\n<p>I listen to music while writing (Pink Floyd, post-rock, epic, ambient, chill genre). It helps my thinking. I also use music to get in the mood and amplify the relevant emotions.</p>\n<p>There are three steps in which I write one letter -</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Think. This occupies most (~80%) of my time.</li>\n<li>Write bullet points or content subjects. These are the gists of the paragraphs.</li>\n<li>Write. I stick to a conversational tone. It differs when I write a blog post or any other literary article.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Almost all of my letters are in the form of emails. The ones written on paper with ink are either not with me or are too personal to share.

It’s really easy to confuse it with genuine love. But for me anyway, infatuation is a lot more like a drug.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It’s a feeling that consumes you with temporary euphoric highs, and deep, dark lows. It’s almost like a panicked state of obsession. It fills your brain so all you can think about is that person. You start to care less about what really matters in your own life...your goals, your friends, your work. All that matters when you’re infatuated, is them. And you feel a strong, leeching desire to mold yourself into the person you think they’d want you to be.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When you’re infatuated with someone, when that person gets closer to you in any way, you feel a rush. Like you’re on cloud 9. Like you just popped a bunch of really good ecstasy. And it feels amazing in the moment. But then when you sense them distancing from you in any way...an ignored text. A rescheduled date. Flirting with another person. Going out on the town without you. Whatever. It feels like the world is crumbling...like you’re going through a withdrawal. You panic and fear you’re going to lose them. There’s a constant push/pull. In those moments of panic all you care about is pulling them back to you. Those up and downs can be maddening over time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>At its core, I think infatuation is latching onto the idealized picture your brain paints of someone. ... You feel in love with them even though you barely know what’s it like to really be with them. ... You start thinking crazy thoughts like “this person is perfect”...”this person is the solution to all of my problems, if I can just keep them I’ll be fulfilled”...”if I can’t have this person I’ll never be genuinely happy”. You think you’re madly in love. But it’s all shallow. Once that person actually starts getting closer to you...the infatuation can wear off pretty quickly...and you can be left feeling confused and deflated. Like a spent firework.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I think most “love at first sight”, and honeymoon periods is really just infatuation. It can turn into love, but it’s not really. And sometimes if you’re not careful, it can blind you and drag you down into some really dark places.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Love on the other hand, is a lot more comfortable. It’s less erratic. It grows slowly over time and stays pretty constant. Its the general feeling of caring and warmth towards someone. You can hate someone in a current moment, but still love them overall. You can find someone to be unattractive, or incompatible...and still love them deep down. You can have a fight with the person you love, and not fear you’re going to lose them...you just want to revolve it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It’s not like a drug...it doesn’t have the highs and lows of infatuation. Its gotta be cultivated and nurtured. You don’t lose yourself in it, or have the drive to turn into the person they want you to be...love helps you find yourself, and drives you to become the person you want to be. Love for a partner isn’t too different than the love you feel for a blood relative. It can be subtle and mellow...sometimes barely recognizable...but it’s always there. You’re connected to them at a deep primal level.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<p>This left me thinking for some time. Some of my thoughts:</p>\n<p><strong>We have little control over our Infatuation, but Love is a practice</strong>. It is comforting to know that love is not a fixed biological property which is set since birth. It is so much about our choices. We can learn to love and become one with it. We can teach people to practice love. Infact, there exists a very profoud meditation technique called \"Loving-Kindness\".</p>\n<p><strong>People can sometimes fall in love with their infatuation but never the person</strong>. This is so interesting to think about! This can give someone a feeling of being in love. But as the infatuation fades, the love fades as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Infatuation is not bad at all</strong>. It's as if, infatuation is our survival mechanism. But love goes beyond just surviving. It is spiritual.</p>\n<p><strong>Love is not an emotion</strong>. Happiness and Sadness come in phases. They are emotions. But love is always present, in us. Our mind may get distracted sometimes. (This is whole another perception, which I felt in one experience.)</p>\n<p><strong>Love is very fundamental and not complicated</strong>. Day passes by and my definition of love keeps getting shorter. Something so easy to experience, so difficult to express.</p>","timeToRead":3}},{"node":{"id":"bbd8da57-fdf5-56dc-ba86-abf809027165","frontmatter":{"categories":["Non-Tech"],"date":"Nov 2018","draft":false,"slug":"/blog/aur-tasveerein","subtitle":"","summary":"","title":"और तसवीरें आने को हैं न !"},"html":"<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrlWoA4D5XQ\">You can listen to my naratted version on Youtube.</a></p>\n<hr>\n<p>जो इन रंगों से कागज़ तुम सजाते हो,</p>\n<p>जो ये सुन्दर रंग-चित्र तुम बनाते हो,</p>\n<p>तुम्हारे मन में अभी</p>\n<p>और तसवीरें आने को हैं न !</p>\n<h1>.</h1>\n<p>जो मधुर गीत ये तुम सुनाते हो,</p>\n<p>धुन ये प्यारी गुन गुनाते हो,</p>\n<p>तुम्हारे दिल में अभी</p>\n<p>और तरंगें बजने को हैं न !</p>\n<h1>.</h1>\n<p>जो ये प्यारी बातें उसे बताते हो,</p>\n<p>जो ये सुन्दर सपनें खुदको दिखाते हो,</p>\n<p>तुम्हारी ज़िन्दगी में</p>\n<p>कितना और सोचने को है न !</p>\n<h1>.</h1>\n<p>कलम को कागज़ से यूँ लगाते हो,</p>\n<p>जो रोज़ तुम कविताएँ नयी बनाते हो,</p>\n<p>तुमको अभी और</p>\n<p>कितना कुछ लिखने को है न !</p>","timeToRead":1}},{"node":{"id":"0da9a4a7-8db0-521b-8c9b-c1013b981286","frontmatter":{"categories":["Non-Tech"],"date":"Oct 2018","draft":false,"slug":"/blog/threads","subtitle":"","summary":"","title":"Threads"},"html":"<blockquote>\n<p>“You’re an interesting species.

Let’s say it happens that both of us are online at the same time. Mr X searched for <code class=\"language-text\">New movies</code> in their favorite DC client e.g. DC++, LinuxDC++, etc. Their client sends this request to the hub we both are connected, to fetch a search result. The hub then forwards the request to <em>everyone</em> who is connected to it and returns the index for Mr X to click and download any file from anyone.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>SO GIVE ME THE SCRIPT. OR DO YOU HAVE THE CODE OR A REPOSITORY?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There isn’t really a script or any code. :/</p>\n<h2>Exploit</h2>\n<p>Because of the theory, we can sit back, stay connected to the hub and receive a holy large amount of data like</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Who joined/left the hub when, their nick and their IP address</li>\n<li>What are people searching for and IP address associated with each query</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you are in KGP, you can <a href=\"https://wiki.metakgp.org/w/IP_allocation\">trace back the IP addresses to even room numbers</a>.</p>\n<h2>Technology</h2>\n<p>Normal DC clients won’t allow us to see these requests.

But if you really want to live stream the searches and that to be accessible outside of the campus network, there is a hack. You can have a server hosted somewhere outside the network which is going to stream data to the public. Share the URL of this server to people you want to. Create an endpoint over here which can receive data through POST request. Now, use your laptop from inside the network to constantly send requests on to the server. Make sure to use authentication by headers to avoid exploitation!</p>\n<p>There’s <a href=\"https://github.com/OrkoHunter/dc-audio/\">some</a> leftover <a href=\"https://github.com/OrkoHunter/dctrends\">code</a> if you can find use of them.</p>\n<p>Now you have this, here’s something you need to remember: Don’t be dick.

As the title suggests, I have had many musings upon the similarity and the differences of these three entities which can be thought as a subset of ‘<em>I’</em> and which have very diffused boundaries among their definitions.</p>\n<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: The following ideas are highly subjective. I would not advise the reader to consider them factual. Also, instead of focusing too much on the scientific details, the reader should try to read the hints to what I’m trying to communicate by using language.</p>\n<h3>Let’s Define</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Cogito ergo sum (I think therefore I am) — René Descartes</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The entity ‘I’ or ‘Me’ is a strange topic of discussion. While some people would oversimplify this to the human body, others might overcomplicate and make this is a subject of spiritual mysticism. I want to remain sane on this topic and probably write the words which can make sense in daily life.</p>\n<p>For me, the majority of ‘I’ is divided into three parts or layers, namely the Brain, the Mind and the Consciousness. The Brain is the outermost layer, the frontier of the Self. Take a scenario for example. You are reading this text. The first ‘You’ is your eyes, receiving colorful light rays from the screen. The ‘You’ then converts this information into electrical signals for further processing. This part is called Brain. It is an entirely physical entity, made of matter which interacts with the outer world through our senses, i.e., sight, touch, smell, taste, and sound.</p>\n<p>The Brain is very close to a computer program, and vice versa. It is programmed to execute in a definite manner. When given a set of inputs, it runs the required number and type of processes and is done with it. It encounters bugs in its lifetime which causes the dysfunctioning of some module. It also has a computing power and needs resources such as oxygen and food.</p>\n<p>The Brain then tries to pass this information to our Consciousness but in comes the Mind. The Mind is that child of ours, whom we love so much that we probably can never stop listening to. The Mind constitutes of our thoughts, our emotions associated with those thoughts, reactions and Ego. If you have disliked this essay so far, your brain has nothing to do with it; it just is feeding the information to your Mind, which is sitting only to judge the content. The Mind will then react and ask your Brain (followed by the senses) to either continue or stop reading.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 711px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/2c3059ad499ed155795455ff110b1258/5e9f9/circle-of-i.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 78.88888888888889%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n          <source\n              srcset=\"/static/2c3059ad499ed155795455ff110b1258/7c297/circle-of-i.webp 180w,\n/static/2c3059ad499ed155795455ff110b1258/33ecc/circle-of-i.webp 360w,\n/static/2c3059ad499ed155795455ff110b1258/f6f2c/circle-of-i.webp 711w\"\n              sizes=\"(max-width: 711px) 100vw, 711px\"\n              type=\"image/webp\"\n            />\n          <source\n            srcset=\"/static/2c3059ad499ed155795455ff110b1258/e9ea2/circle-of-i.png 180w,\n/static/2c3059ad499ed155795455ff110b1258/53918/circle-of-i.png 360w,\n/static/2c3059ad499ed155795455ff110b1258/5e9f9/circle-of-i.png 711w\"\n            sizes=\"(max-width: 711px) 100vw, 711px\"\n            type=\"image/png\"\n          />\n          <img\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n            src=\"/static/2c3059ad499ed155795455ff110b1258/5e9f9/circle-of-i.png\"\n            alt=\"‘I’ in terms of processing an information\"\n            title=\"‘I’ in terms of processing an information\"\n            loading=\"lazy\"\n            decoding=\"async\"\n            style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n          />\n        </picture>\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>We can look at the Mind as a semi-physical entity.

It is a thoughtless entity. It can interchangeably be understood as ‘the energy of life’. If you have ever been a psychonaut, this is the ‘vibration’ part of self, and it does communicate to other consciousness. If your consciousness is unaware of something which only your brain and mind knows (Take the statement ‘<em>We should love everyone</em>’ for example), it is entirely possible that you might react unexpectedly in extreme situations, contradictory to what you think you should never have done.</p>\n<h3>The Chariot</h3>\n<p>Do you remember the scene from the epic Mahabharat? During the battle scene, the chariot with the most attention was of Arjun. Now there’s a great symbolism to be drawn from the setting. There is Arjun with all the weapons, perplexed with the myriad of thoughts about the battle, sitting on a chariot with Krishna, who is calm and patiently replying to all of the questions thrown by Arjun. Krishna is also the charioteer, holding the reins. There are horses driving the chariot, and finally, there’s the battleground, the vast ground where the chariot can roam around and interact with other chariots and other entities.</p>\n<p>Collectively if we are to compare this one picture with ‘I,’ the chariot is similar to a Body. Arjun is like the Mind having all of its thoughts, ego, and confusions. Krishna is the inner Consciousness. The reins connect the Mind with the horses, which are to be interpreted as the senses we use to interact with the external world, which here is the entire battleground of Kurukshetra. The ‘I’ functions when everything is at their place, resonating in perfect coordination.</p>\n<p>After all the questionnaire (popularly known as Bhagavad Gita), Krishna drives the chariot and is only capable of waking Arjun up and channeling all of his powers. I don’t know how reliable this symbolism should be held but loosely it’s very similar to the game of Mind and Consciousness.</p>\n<h3>Change</h3>\n<p><em>How are these entities altered?</em></p>\n<p>Changing the Brain is straightforward. One can close their eyes, put on earphones with music and there, the state of their Brain is now different. But closing the eyes does not mean the person shall stop thinking about it. The change in Brain has little to no effects on the Mind.</p>\n<p>Changing the Mind is a tedious process. It requires expertise to govern thoughts from coming in and going out. It is a long process to gain control over one’s Ego. These methods can be classified under various Meditative techniques.</p>\n<p>Changing the Consciousness makes you a Psychonaut. A Psychonaut is a person who experiences intentionally induced altered states of consciousness and claims to use the experience to investigate his or her Mind, and possibly address spiritual questions, through direct experience. A change in Consciousness will, by default, reflect on the Mind and the Brain as well.</p>\n<p>When people talk about Enlightenment, they mean altered Consciousness and not a new Mind. All the humans feel love, sadness, hate, anger, etc., every single one of us and is, in fact, one of the traits which define us. A monk in the Himalayas is undoubtedly not deprived of Mind, but they probably know how to open up with the Consciousness directly and not let Mind be a middle-man.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Enlightenment doesn’t care how we reach there. — Thaddeus Golas</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The consciousness can be altered with prolonged meditation (very subjective to the technique and the person). The use of naturally occurring mushrooms containing psilocybin, DMT, LSD and many other psychedelic and psychoactive substances can also challenge Consciousness to its very core.</p>\n<h3>Communication</h3>\n<p>I’m not sure if there is any test to know whether some information which was thrown at us, has reached our consciousness or not. Merely hearing it ensures Brain level perception. Pondering over it as a thought provides that it is floating in our Mind. But how can we know if our Consciousness is aware of it?</p>\n<p>There is one practice which can make sure the thought isn’t stuck in the Mind. The method is to “Avoid Overthinking.” Overthinking is terrible. It is a risky business. On the one hand, it opens up new insights to a thought, on the other side it leads to the loss of reality and makes it very hard for any information to escape from our Minds. Another good practice is to not letting our Ego come into the picture. We can do it by not allowing our subjective feelings and judgment interfere while we catch a piece of information.</p>\n<p>Knowing that ‘I’ can be dissolved into these three entities can have very positive effects while communicating with others. If we can see that our words will be reflected by their layer of Ego, there is no way we can deliver our message to them despite speaking for any length of time, since it will never reach their Consciousness. We can then find out the correct choice of words to avoid their shiny surface of Mind which is eager to reflect anything that is thrown towards it such that it pierces through and reaches their Consciousness.</p>\n<p>Many times, we have the tendency to solve a problem with another person, just by speaking to them. Example can be a conflict of interest with our parents, friends or a significant other. But it’s wise to understand that the situation might have left the Mind of the other person very confused, and it’s best not to talk since our words will quickly bounce off them. It’s better to sit back, wait, till they work out with their Mind and are ready to communicate. Interesting to note that this is counter-intuitive to our Minds which quickly reacts by blabbering out whatever we can.</p>\n<h3>I am not my Thoughts</h3>\n<p>Why is “watching the breath” one of the first and simplest meditation techniques? During Vipassana, it is suggested to start first by the practice of watching the whole breathing cycle and rather focus on the nostrils. This is not Vipassana, but it acts as an anchor to calm the Mind so that we would be able to do the actual practice. We can give an analogy of the mind to that of a chattering monkey. The Mind usually does not shut up and keeps feeding us with thoughts, ego, and their effects. We then tell the Mind, “O hey! Do you see this? Do you see me inhaling and exhaling? It’s beautiful, isn’t it? Watch!”. It’s like giving a crying baby, a toy to play with and making her come at ease.</p>\n<p>Once we start watching our thoughts, we begin to accept, and later appreciate the meaninglessness of them. Merely by watching them come and go, we build up a tolerance for a reaction, and it stops us from engaging from them in the future. We learn how futile are our thoughts, opinions, and judgments. Often at times, people are afraid of meaninglessness, which makes them value their thoughts very much. This makes them misinterpret that they are their thoughts, and thus, they build up a thick layer over their Consciousness, which is another meaningless and thoughtless entity. There is a possibility that life gets more beautiful if we stop yearning for everything to be meaningful.</p>\n<h3>Ego</h3>\n<p>Ego is a word which has been overstated and misunderstood a lot of times. Never is one’s true ego positive or negative, it’s the thoughts associated with it. A negative thought pattern can be removed while keeping the Ego intact. We just can’t let it happen very easily, since it’s so powerful. Ego is the ID of the Mind; it’s what makes us respond to someone calling our name. It might sound blissful to live after ‘Ego Death’, but that’s not how anyone can survive. Killing one’s ego is killing Self.</p>\n<p>If ego death isn’t desirable, then what is? Here is a comment from <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/43oysz/how_is_ego_death_beneficial/czjv2nn/\">/r/Psychonaut</a> which I find very relevant.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Personally, I don’t believe complete Ego death is possible, or even desirable. What I suggest is mastery of the Ego. Think of it like a wild animal to be tamed instead of destroyed. It is a part of you, an integral and important one, in fact, but for most people, it’s grown monstrous and completely out of control. Or put differently, it is in full control. And so we become passengers in these meat machines, with the Ego at the wheel. Dangerous stuff!\nThe Ego is only the Ego so long as it remains distinct and separate from the rest of you. The process we should undergo is what Carl Jung called individuation: the uniting of a fractured mind, of a psyche, compartmentalized and segregated into individual parts; the merging of conscious and unconscious, Self and Ego, reasoning mind and intuitive mind. The result is that we become indivisible, whole, balanced, and more importantly, in control.\nHow does this benefit you? Well, imagine two pilots wrestling for control of the ship. Good luck getting to your destination! Or better yet, good luck agreeing on a target. Before individuation, we’re torn and divided, conflicted and confused. We’re being driven, not doing the driving, you see? The Ego wants one thing, the Self another, and then it’s a battle for control. Or else the Ego is whispering sweet lies, and the Self is buying them wholesale so that the Self comes to believe that it and the Ego are one. This is a nice little tactic by the Ego, and one that can be observed in people on a daily basis. Defensiveness is an obvious indication of Ego identification. What are you defending? An opinion? A belief? A role? These things are not you, only things you do or things you cling to, but the Ego grows strong from false identification and so pokes and prods you into getting your back up whenever these are called into question.\nHow do you merge with the shadow? The first step is identifying it in yourself by distinguishing between the essential you — the Self, or pure consciousness — and the stuff that isn’t you. By watching your thoughts, words, and actions, seeking out incoherence and contradictions, defensiveness and sore spots, and then calling these into question. Be harsh with yourself. And whatever you do, don’t shy away from the ugly bits: that’s where the Ego likes to hide out.### Ignorance</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Don’t we hate it when we write or speak all the facts and support our argument while the person on the other side just <em>chooses</em> to ignore those and raises some of their own? It is happening every second on Facebook and Twitter comments section, and it’s eating out a lot of Brains. But why do people choose to be ignorant?</p>\n<p>The moment we add our entire Mind in the equation of <em>thought process</em>, it by default, includes the sensations in our body, emotional reactions, opinions, and separately, the Brainly activities, i.e., Reading/Listening and Writing/Speaking. Now, the Brain has no trouble in receiving any argument, neither the Consciousness has; but it’s the Mind, and if the words are causing any unpleasant sensations, we tend to reject it. And that’s where we lose.</p>\n<p>No sensation is either good or bad. However, it <em>will</em> arise. It’s natural for all of us. The key is not in ceasing it, but accepting it, accepting that impermanence is a real thing. The sensations have come, only to pass away. It has no real meaning, and we should not be trying to give it any value. We indulge in reactions too often and thus end up losing the direct communication with our Consciousness.</p>\n<h3>Consciousness</h3>\n<p>To me, we only know the tip of the iceberg known as Consciousness. I am very impressed by Yuval Noah Harari’s understanding of the consciousness and the scientific aspects of it, written in his book <em>Homo Deus</em>. To me, understanding one’s consciousness is a very complicated subject since it’s very easy to overthink it. It is the subjective ability to experience. Anything can be an experience, merely sitting somewhere alone in lush green, or talking to a person, or watching the leaves fall from a tree, anything and everything can become an experience and our consciousness is responsible for the subjective aspects of it.</p>\n<p>I’m not capable of writing about it. I’m not capable of using terms like ‘Vibration’ and ‘Energy’ to describe it. But I secretly wish, for a scientific explanation in centuries when we’d be pondering over the consciousness of Artificial Intelligence. Even if I can see things as it is (it’s the literal meaning of <em>Vipassana</em>), I wish things to be proven for a systematic understanding by the humanity. Wait, what is String Theory <em>again</em>?</p>","timeToRead":11}},{"node":{"id":"f63e11f2-791b-57e4-a1dd-9eb70b55e096","frontmatter":{"categories":["Tech","Non-Tech"],"date":"Mar 2018","draft":false,"slug":"/blog/delete-facebook","subtitle":"","summary":"","title":"#DeleteFacebook"},"html":"<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 720px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/f0d3d55e0329b720331a068b6e7e97fa/78d47/deleted.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 54.44444444444444%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n          <source\n              srcset=\"/static/f0d3d55e0329b720331a068b6e7e97fa/7c297/deleted.webp 180w,\n/static/f0d3d55e0329b720331a068b6e7e97fa/33ecc/deleted.webp 360w,\n/static/f0d3d55e0329b720331a068b6e7e97fa/df77d/deleted.webp 720w,\n/static/f0d3d55e0329b720331a068b6e7e97fa/cf465/deleted.webp 800w\"\n              sizes=\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\"\n              type=\"image/webp\"\n            />\n          <source\n            srcset=\"/static/f0d3d55e0329b720331a068b6e7e97fa/e9ea2/deleted.png 180w,\n/static/f0d3d55e0329b720331a068b6e7e97fa/53918/deleted.png 360w,\n/static/f0d3d55e0329b720331a068b6e7e97fa/242a6/deleted.png 720w,\n/static/f0d3d55e0329b720331a068b6e7e97fa/78d47/deleted.png 800w\"\n            sizes=\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\"\n            type=\"image/png\"\n          />\n          <img\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n            src=\"/static/f0d3d55e0329b720331a068b6e7e97fa/242a6/deleted.png\"\n            alt=\"deleted\"\n            title=\"deleted\"\n            loading=\"lazy\"\n            decoding=\"async\"\n            style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n          />\n        </picture>\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>After letting Facebook Inc. build a vast profile of me for 9 years, I deleted my facebook account.

If we pick two homo sapiens on earth, we can classify their relationship as one of these three types:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>An Acquaintance (Both of them are acquainted with each other)</li>\n<li>Unfamiliarity (No one knows about the existence of other)</li>\n<li>Celebrity status (One of the two is famous)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Today is the dawn of the 21st century. And every day in my college I meet few people who fall in none of the three types.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Every day I see people on 2.2, whom I know by face and name, as well as they know me and my name. But we don’t stop to say, ‘Hi’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>These are my <em>pseudo-acquaintances</em> whom I got to know from Facebook.</em></p>\n<p>Here is the deal. Somewhere in the data centers of Facebook Inc, there is a matrix which stores the connection between two nodes, and the edge value of those people and me is True. There have been numerous CSS divs containing strings which either they or I have written, which got a click from the other, sometimes a further div of “comment” as well. Somehow, subconsciously my brain understood that a person and I had interacted a whole bunch and thus we are friends. But when the same mind physically spots them in public, that same person for the first time in months, there is no surge of emotions to go and talk to them.</p>\n<p>I know someone on Facebook, I “interact” with them, but I don’t speak with the same passion or eagerness to them in real life, using flesh and bones. For me, it is terrifying. What if people eventually stop using their mouth for conversations because Whatsapp and Messenger let them use that gif meme to convey more efficiently. What if we discover some other app or platform to express ourselves in the best way which is different than meeting the person and using our mouth, eyes, face, hands or smile to express?</p>\n<p>And the fact that the first world countries already have incorporated a bit of this culture, raises merely questions about parenting. What if we are not concerned about our children, and the first friend they make, do not physically exist around them. I am surely, not saying one is better than others; there are so many pros of the Scientific Revolution, Internet being a tiny monster of it. I am just saying that, are people responsible? Is Facebook responsible enough to know that it has created an illusion of friendships and relationship and does it care about it? From the weekly product and feature launches, for the sole purpose of us interacting more on their platform, and increasing their value as advertisers and not looking up from our phones, I think it does not care at all. Or is it in control of anyone to care about it? Something like a trained Deep Learning model, over which we only have very few control after some time.</p>\n<hr>\n<br>\n> This article above was an email to a few close friends, right after I realized my first pseudo-acquaintance. I am thankful to their responses, they made me rethink every bit.\n<p>It has been quite long since I joined Facebook.com and I have spent a lot of time with the product. I have met and stayed connected with a lot of people using this platform, and therefore, I am probably thankful for it. However, here is my current setup, as of now:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I don’t use the product ‘news feed’. I use a version of News Feed Eradicator.</li>\n<li>I ran a custom Javascript script to unfollow all of my Facebook friends and then turned on the notifications for few, as I deemed necessary in my real life.</li>\n<li>On the phone, I do not have the Facebook app and I use messenger with the setting where I do not receive any notification (interrupts) but I would instead open the app to see if there any new messages.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The last thing that I want to say is that there are mostly no good and no wrong sides. As a human, we always have to use our discretion and find something in between. Hence I can not blindly delete Facebook to solve this problem, I’ll have to see the way to use it for my productivity, as long as it doesn’t consume a lot of my time to do that.</p>\n<hr>\n<br>\nUpdate, [I deleted my Facebook account](https://medium.com/@OrkoHunter/deletefacebook-10f365c5d36e).","timeToRead":3}},{"node":{"id":"28b35707-76b1-5495-ac81-09995417b825","frontmatter":{"categories":["Tech"],"date":"Feb 2018","draft":false,"slug":"/blog/twitter-vs-facebook","subtitle":"","summary":"","title":"Design of Public Posts: Twitter vs Facebook"},"html":"<blockquote>\n<p>What design tells you about the company’s values</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Both Facebook and Twitter allow posts to be publicly accessible by people who have not joined the platform.

And the Stage 1 has <em>zero</em> information about the post (which was the sole purpose of opening that particular URL). The only way to close this banner is to find that tiny <em>Not Now</em> text below the big Green <em>Create New Account</em>. An interesting design flaw (whether intentional or by mistake) is that the typography of <em>Not Now</em> and <em>Forgotten Account?</em> is exactly the same, even when the later button is clicked once a hundred times and the former 99 out of 100 times. I think it’s intentional.</p>\n<p>Let’s click on <em>Not Now</em>, and move the <strong>Stage 2</strong> of the view.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 720px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/d638c58618ade228ab512a304d3e88bc/1263b/1*DjkjiZQ7_yC_IADORFLO_Q.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 57.77777777777777%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n          <source\n              srcset=\"/static/d638c58618ade228ab512a304d3e88bc/7c297/1*DjkjiZQ7_yC_IADORFLO_Q.webp 180w,\n/static/d638c58618ade228ab512a304d3e88bc/33ecc/1*DjkjiZQ7_yC_IADORFLO_Q.webp 360w,\n/static/d638c58618ade228ab512a304d3e88bc/df77d/1*DjkjiZQ7_yC_IADORFLO_Q.webp 720w,\n/static/d638c58618ade228ab512a304d3e88bc/80c60/1*DjkjiZQ7_yC_IADORFLO_Q.webp 1000w\"\n              sizes=\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\"\n              type=\"image/webp\"\n            />\n          <source\n            srcset=\"/static/d638c58618ade228ab512a304d3e88bc/e9ea2/1*DjkjiZQ7_yC_IADORFLO_Q.png 180w,\n/static/d638c58618ade228ab512a304d3e88bc/53918/1*DjkjiZQ7_yC_IADORFLO_Q.png 360w,\n/static/d638c58618ade228ab512a304d3e88bc/242a6/1*DjkjiZQ7_yC_IADORFLO_Q.png 720w,\n/static/d638c58618ade228ab512a304d3e88bc/1263b/1*DjkjiZQ7_yC_IADORFLO_Q.png 1000w\"\n            sizes=\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\"\n            type=\"image/png\"\n          />\n          <img\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n            src=\"/static/d638c58618ade228ab512a304d3e88bc/242a6/1*DjkjiZQ7_yC_IADORFLO_Q.png\"\n            alt=\"1 DjkjiZQ7 yC IADORFLO Q\"\n            title=\"1 DjkjiZQ7 yC IADORFLO Q\"\n            loading=\"lazy\"\n            decoding=\"async\"\n            style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n          />\n        </picture>\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>On this webpage, the area covered with the information about the post is still comparable or maybe less than the <em>engageble area of log in and sign up</em>.

Some got the <em>success</em> while some are still trying. But to my astonishment, I found that the degree of comfort in each one of them was not as expected. What I mean by that is, not everyone who got this success was happy, and not everyone who failed was sad, although the majority was skewed on the side of the former case.</p>\n<p>As I broadened my perspective and timeframe, I found that getting a job which pays in money, is not something which can give satisfaction to every human being. We cannot universally advise this to everyone. If you think so, then please understand the gravity of human population on this planet, and my concern was about satisfaction which is difficult to define, since a large part of it loses touch with materialism.</p>\n<p>So, I aligned my line of thought with <strong><em>loving the work we do</em></strong>. If a farmer spends the day on their field, and they enjoy it, then it’s good, isn’t it? How about the software engineer who thinks their technology can help people or maybe due to some other reason, they find love in the code, they write? I found that it was closer to being a ubiquitous activity which can keep people happy, or at least a large number of humans. But then, I saw people who do not have any job at first place. By <em>job</em>, I mean an activity which benefits people and provides something (<em>e.g. salary</em>) in return for the individual. But there are wanderers, <em>fakirs</em>, hitchhikers and many types of <em>unemployed</em> people. So, are they different from <em>regular</em>? These people challenged the universality of this line of thought.</p>\n<p>It further gave me an idea that instead of (or along with) loving the work, we also need to <strong><em>enjoy with the peers who surround us</em></strong>. So, a lot of human beings are embraced by their parents, friends and/or children. It does not happen always, but we can still find some of these in different bandwidths of our life. It reminded me of the letter by Richard Feynman, <a href=\"https://fs.blog/2014/08/richard-feynman-what-problems-to-solve\">Do not remain nameless to yourself</a>. So yeah, Living in love can be a universal thing to do. And it allowed me to picture this massive population of ours on the planet earth. But then, I found exceptions. I thought of Chris McCandless (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Into_the_Wild_%28film%29\"><em>Into the wild</em></a>) and how he did not find love in his family but Nature.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 720px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/2b689703566016580f720f5e5f33e1dc/0a251/into_the_wild.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 41.66666666666667%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n          <source\n              srcset=\"/static/2b689703566016580f720f5e5f33e1dc/7c297/into_the_wild.webp 180w,\n/static/2b689703566016580f720f5e5f33e1dc/33ecc/into_the_wild.webp 360w,\n/static/2b689703566016580f720f5e5f33e1dc/df77d/into_the_wild.webp 720w,\n/static/2b689703566016580f720f5e5f33e1dc/80c60/into_the_wild.webp 1000w\"\n              sizes=\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\"\n              type=\"image/webp\"\n            />\n          <source\n            srcset=\"/static/2b689703566016580f720f5e5f33e1dc/98e5d/into_the_wild.jpg 180w,\n/static/2b689703566016580f720f5e5f33e1dc/543cd/into_the_wild.jpg 360w,\n/static/2b689703566016580f720f5e5f33e1dc/20801/into_the_wild.jpg 720w,\n/static/2b689703566016580f720f5e5f33e1dc/0a251/into_the_wild.jpg 1000w\"\n            sizes=\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\"\n            type=\"image/jpeg\"\n          />\n          <img\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n            src=\"/static/2b689703566016580f720f5e5f33e1dc/20801/into_the_wild.jpg\"\n            alt=\"A scene from the movie Into the Wild\"\n            title=\"A scene from the movie Into the Wild\"\n            loading=\"lazy\"\n            decoding=\"async\"\n            style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n          />\n        </picture>\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>I was back to square one. Do we need another human being to live this life, happily? People can not always surround us. And further, outside of seven billion humans, there are other lives as well. What about dogs, or the trees, plants, and flowers which are alive? Or a lost animal somewhere in the jungle. Do they have to have a peer to share the love or their <em>pursuit of happiness</em>?</p>\n<p>My problem set got bigger, and I appreciated <em>how difficult it must be for a democracy to form its constitution</em> or King Hammurabi to write his <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_Hammurabi\">code</a>. At this point, I felt a little exhausted in finding the answer to my question (it had been several months by now).</p>\n<p>But a few days ago, as I was practicing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vipassan%C4%81#Vipassana-meditation_in_the_modern_Vipassana_movement\">Vipassana Meditation</a>, I had an epiphany about the question. I realized how much did I miss to observe about my own physical body even when there was so much going on already. I never noticed my breath on its whole (trust me, when I say, I still have not). The moment we start to breathe in, and it goes on for a full length, and then it stops. A moment of no activity, and then we breathe out. And the cycle repeats. Breathing is just one of the many involuntary signs of life, and yet it goes on unnoticed. It made me regard the totality around me, even more. To mention a few, the breeze which blows past me when I stroll on <a href=\"https://wiki.metakgp.org/w/2.2\">2.2</a>, the distant sound I listen to while typing this text, the leaves which fall off from the trees when I sit with a cup of <em>chai</em> at <a href=\"https://www.google.co.in/maps/place/Bhaski%27s/@22.3161081,87.2988514,21z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x3a1d43feddbb1c35:0xeff718f07e02348!8m2!3d22.3159891!4d87.2987071\">Bhaski’s</a>, and other many signs of life.</p>\n<p>I think, for the question of <em>“What is something which should be the universal action of everyone?”</em>, I can put it in words as “<em>To witness”</em>. We necessarily do not have to think, question, or react to the activities around us or <em>even inside us</em>, but to just witness the presence of life. In Sanskrit, we call this state of no-mind as निर्विचार. I felt that generally, we are ignorant of ourselves and we miss to observe a lot. With this awareness and focus, the decisions we make are quite apparent, and we can then work on optimizing our limited time on this planet to do something.</p>","timeToRead":4}},{"node":{"id":"fc57b818-1592-5b76-858c-ddc96f2415b7","frontmatter":{"categories":["Tech"],"date":"May 2017","draft":false,"slug":"/blog/python-easter-eggs","subtitle":"","summary":"","title":"Python's easter eggs and hidden jokes"},"html":"<blockquote>\n<p>Just when you thought, Python could not be more fun.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Read on GitHub</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/OrkoHunter/python-easter-eggs\">https://github.com/OrkoHunter/python-easter-eggs</a></p>\n<h3>1.

But what people do now is that they post it on Instagram and then share it over Facebook. This is the most meaningless aspect of Facebook after pokes. Why do you expect someone to see (follow) your photos on Instagram if they do not know you at all? And if they do, you are definitely friends with them on Facebook.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Poorly composed pictures clearly showing you having fun</strong>\nWhy do people start migrating away from Facebook? This happened when their friends started using Facebook as a <em>PR tool</em>, to estabilish that they are living a good life, irrespective of the reality.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now, what would happen if you would post your party pictures, your fun trips stories on Instagram? Don’t they already have enough from you, on Facebook?</p>\n<h3>How to fix it?</h3>\n<p>Quoting Nerdwriter1 here, “Before posting anything on the social media, think a little about Why you post what you post.”</p>\n<p>We can have all of Flickr, 500px, Imgur on Instagram, with a better and more familiar social network. But like <a href=\"http://news.ycombinator.com\">Hacker News</a> and <a href=\"http://reddit.com\">Reddit</a> and unlike <a href=\"http://www.quitfacebookday.com/\">Facebook</a>, it is **okay <em>not to</em> <em>post,</em> but just consume the beauty out of it. So, put the peer pressure off and enjoy following <a href=\"http://www.creativebloq.com/photography/instagram-2131996\">some amazing photographers</a> on Instagram. And hey, it’s perfectly cool if you share your photography skills over there too ! It’s a social network after all. And it’s also alright if you click a cute picture of a child you spotted in a village. It’s great. Likeways, it’s okay if you post a picture of your own child. Or your spouse. Or your own. Hey wait, maybe I should watch the video again.</p>\n<p>**It’s okay to post a picture of a Human (and it’s not the same)</p>\n<p>Note that I don’t actually hate my friends on instagram. It’s just a momentary disgust, which vanishes away when I hangout with these amazing people.</p>\n<p>Update: <a href=\"/blog/delete-facebook/\">I deleted my Facebook and Instagram account.</a></p>","timeToRead":2}},{"node":{"id":"e2660377-1bd6-571f-b582-a2829557eebb","frontmatter":{"categories":["Tech"],"date":"Feb 2017","draft":false,"slug":"/blog/keep","subtitle":"","summary":"","title":"Keep : A personal shell command keeper"},"html":"<h2>A Meta CLI toolkit</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Writwick Wraj loves using the command line.\nWritwick googles “How to do X in terminal?” and multiple forums and blog posts finally provide him the magical <em>command</em> for the rescue.

Go to <a href=\"https://github.com/\">https://github.com</a>. Pick a username, enter your email id and choose a password. Next, choose <em>unlimited personal repositories for free</em>. In the final step you can give some input to github and voila ! You are now a github user. (If you are redirect from KWoC, use the username there.) There is plethora of git guides over internet, some are really good and some really suck. I here am writing a simple blog for the newbies who have successfully made an account over github and are really excited about it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>GitHub</strong> is a web-based Git repository hosting service, which offers some of the distributed revision control and source code management(SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. Unlike Git, which is strictly a command-line tool, GitHub provides a web-based graphical interface and desktop as well as mobile integration</p>\n<p>Or simply</p>\n<p><strong>Github connects you with other people who are interested in sharing and creating together.</strong></p>\n<p>So there are really two ways to begin with. Here goes the first one.</p>\n<p>Create a repository : Repository is what you call the stuff you are going to upload and work on. Go to <a href=\"https://github.com/new\">https://github.com/new</a> and create a repository. Let’s name it hello-world. \nAdd some description, or you might want to add it later. Initialize it with a Readme. It's a good practice and let's you clone it immediately. (Yeah right, see below)</p>\n<p>Clone it : Open your console, move to the directory where you want to work and do this.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">$ git clone https://github.com/username/hello-world.git</code></pre></div>\n<p>This will create a directory in your computer. Now, this isn’t a simple directory. It is a ‘clone’ of the github repository. You can say that the files in it are controlled by the version control system git and tracked with the repository on github. Note : If you have not installed git, see <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git\">this</a>.</p>\n<p>Do this,</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">$ cd hello-world\n$ git remote -v\norigin https://github.com/&lt;username>/hello-world.git (fetch)\norigin https://github.com/&lt;username>/hello-world.git (push)</code></pre></div>\n<p>This shows that the link to repository of yours at github is known by the name origin over here.</p>\n<p>Now, you will have to configure your name and your email address which you will be using for making the commits (don’t worry about what it means right now, we will cover it soon). This configuring is ideally done only once in a lifetime of your system (or unless you purposely remove your ~/.gitconfig file but that’s the story of another time).</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">$ git config --global user.name \"ABC XYZ\"\n$ git config --global user.email \"abc@xyz.com\"</code></pre></div>\n<p>Now another way of this is first you create the directory on your computer. Navigate inside it and do</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">$ git init</code></pre></div>\n<p>This will initialize an empty git repository inside it. Later, you can add the link to the repository by the git remote command like this</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">$ git remote add origin https://github.com/&lt;username>/hello-world</code></pre></div>\n<p>You can always use <code class=\"language-text\">git remote -v</code> command to track the aliases.</p>\n<p>Making the first change : Okay now we are in condition of adding some files or code to this repository. I am going to make a python file with hello world program and publish the change over the github repository too. \nSo make a new file say hello.py inside the directory, open it with your favorite editor and write the one line code to print whatever you want. Why just hello world? (Because dmr did it!) Now write it and save the file.</p>\n<p>The first thing you should always do is to see whether you have done any changes or not in the repository. This can be done by</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">$ git status</code></p>\n<p>After the changes you made, you must be getting this after git status</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">On branch master\n Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.\n Untracked files:\n (use \"git add &lt;file>...\" to include in what will be committed)\n hello.py\n nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \"git add\" to track)Add, Commit, Push! : In your console, do this.\n\n$ git add .</code></pre></div>\n<p>This adds all the files in the track which you have changed. \nNow it’s time to commit that change. By committing, git understands that you want the change to be in record. Every commit is accompanied with a message that appears on the log (git log). A commit should represent one logical change only which should be supported by a relevant commit message. The convention is to write the commit in the verbal form ie. tell the computer to do that for you. Do this</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">$ git commit -m \"add hello.py\"</code></p>\n<p>You’ve made your first commit! But it won’t be appearing over github, because you made the changes locally. You need to push it over the web. For that, you use</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">$ git push</code></p>\n<p>Or,</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">$ git push origin</code></p>\n<p>to say git where actually you are pushing it to. Or,</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">$ git push origin master</code></p>\n<p>to say git over what branch on origin you are pushing it to.</p>\n<p>That’s it! You’ve published your changes to your GitHub repository.</p>\n<p>NOTE : This is a very basic start. There are more concepts to be explored. You can search for specifics. StackOverflow also has great resources. We’ll leave the nitty gritties of Git for another day.</p>\n<p>Happy Coding!</p>","timeToRead":4}},{"node":{"id":"888d5da8-c324-542e-b94b-af2ddcb77bee","frontmatter":{"categories":["Non-Tech"],"date":"Jan 2017","draft":false,"slug":"/blog/aanshuon-ke-bimb-se","subtitle":"","summary":"","title":"आंसुओं के बिंब से छलकती हुई दुनिया, देखी थी मैंने एक बार"},"html":"<p>आंसुओं के बिंब से छलकती हुई दुनिया, देखी थी मैंने एक बार</p>\n<p>वक्त की गहराईयों में डूबती नज़र आई थी वो</p>\n<p>नज़रों से सहारा दिया मैंने</p>\n<p>ख़ुशी का भरोसा दिया मैंने</p>\n<p>न जाने मेरा हाथ क्यों न थामाँ उसने</p>\n<p>उसे गहराइयों की सुकूँ भाती चली गयी ।</p>\n<h1>.</h1>\n<p>Thanks to Sandeep Jha for the first two lines.</p>","timeToRead":1}},{"node":{"id":"889998b1-5cc1-502b-a279-292be9c245f1","frontmatter":{"categories":["Non-Tech"],"date":"Jan 2017","draft":false,"slug":"/blog/erotomania","subtitle":"","summary":"","title":"Erotomania : An Unfortunate Tale"},"html":"<p>“Hey Wake up!</p>\n<p>Wake up, for you are left with just 30 more minutes.</p>\n<p>You better sleep after this is over; rather that would be your only choice.

So, get up, go get your hair combed, your teeth cleaned, and most importantly collect as much happy thoughts as possible in your stupid brain.”</p>\n<p>The only child of his parents, this kid was a loner, an antisocial introvert who liked to stay back in his shady living-slash-playing room, and wished to stay there for lifetime. Skipping school since the fourth grade, his mother very well accepted his social awkwardness as well as his mind’s disability and was happy with hiding it from the rest of the world. Whilst I, I watched him grow, I kept calling out for him, in his good times, or bad. I lived in him.</p>\n<p>When he was 10, his mother was relocated to a new place, around 50 kilometres from the capital, a place where neighbourhood was as far as the corner shop in the hometown. He was terrified. He had to greet the visitors all along. It was then, he met his first friend, a girl. After she came into his life, there was no shady place, in his house, or heart or anywhere. <em>‘I love when Vaidehi blinks and smiles at the same time’</em>, he’d say to his mom. One day, it was evident to him, that Vaidehi had the most beautiful eyes he’d ever seen. I still remember how his mother must have felt when she would have realised that his son had one more best friend now.</p>\n<p>His mother was long gone before he’d even think of proposing Vaidehi to marry. It was the same girl, the only girl he’d ever spoken two words to. He left his mother’s house and starting living with her at a completely new place. <em>‘I’ve kept your lunch in the kitchen, heat it carefully, okay? I’ll be back by 7'</em>, she used to say every morning to him, like a mother warning his kid before herself going out.</p>\n<p>Apart from his “work from home” job, he was passionate about clicking pictures. Or rather, he liked to save the moments he was enjoying with her. Some days, he used to shuffle between them, recollect the memories, shed a few tears, curl up on the bed and just wait for her to come in the evening. He was also good at dodging off important calls.</p>\n<p>Best were the college days, when he started perceiving how real, the real world was. He was afraid on the first day. Four years later, he had a job, a “work from home” job, a girlfriend, and no family. But he had learnt how to ignore bullies and be in love, or at least that’s what he’d think.</p>\n<p><em>‘Come in the City Hospital ASAP. Your wife is here.’</em> Some lady spoke on the phone. The call was from Vaidehi’s number. He rushed out, alone in the traffic and around so many people. He was little mad at her, why she didn’t take time off work during her last months.</p>\n<p><em>‘It’s a baby girl’</em>, The nurse announced.</p>\n<p><em>‘Let’s call her Gayatri’</em>, Vaidehi said.</p>\n<p><em>‘That’s a beautiful name’</em></p>\n<p><em>‘It’s your mother’s.’</em></p>\n<p><em>‘Oh yes. Of course.’</em></p>\n<p>As the Judge broke the nip of the pen, he declared : \n<em>‘According to the evidences presented by the accused himself and his self-admittance, the suspect, on charge of murdering his wife and his baby child, is hereby sentenced to be hanged till death on the month’s last day at sunrise. May God have mercy upon his soul.’</em></p>\n<p>She was drunk. One day, when she came home. Or maybe high, he could not figure, he remembers, during college days, she had mentioned one of her female friend who was into heroin at those times.</p>\n<p>Vaidehi’s call history. Her friend’s name in recent calls. She was definitely high.</p>\n<p>He could not dare speak a word to her. He made sure the little girl is fast asleep.</p>\n<p>She started abusing herself on daily basis. He was worried. He considered himself to be at fault. Maybe, she was not enjoying with him as much as he was. Maybe she didn’t love him like he did.</p>\n<p><em>‘Nah! That can’t be it.’</em></p>\n<p>Gayatri got into kinder garden. More house chores. Vaidehi couldn’t find time to visit her friend these days. She did go to work, but usually cut short her work hours in the evening. She was not happy.</p>\n<p><em>‘I will make her feel good.’</em> Maybe one more kid? Maybe pregnancy will stop her from drugs? He knew if he’ll ask her, she would politely refuse or unwillingly agree considering her husband’s wish. Let it be an accident. Months passed, he started worrying. Nothing happened. How about a medical check-up?</p>\n<p><em>‘I’m sorry sir, but you are infertile’</em>, the doc said.</p>\n<p>Within seconds, the first face to appear in front of him, was of his cute little daughter, Gayatri.</p>\n<p>Call history. Her friend’s name is still there. Ring, ring. <em>‘Hello?’</em>, a hoarse voice; shocked to the bottom of his hearts. It was of a man.</p>\n<p>This is about the night, the night he became the “accused”. Vaidehi was chopping off vegetables in the kitchen. He was looking at Gayatri, smiling, wondering. He could not hold any longer. He sneaked in.</p>\n<p><em>‘Hey’</em></p>\n<p>_’Sorry I got late, had lots of pending work at office. Dinner would be ready soon. I’m preparing noodle soup and rice. _</p>\n<p><em>‘I had to talk to you about something. I am sorry.’</em></p>\n<p>She stopped. <em>‘What happened?’</em></p>\n<p><em>‘I am sorry, I checked your email.’</em> His heartbeat racing fast.</p>\n<p><em>‘Why the fuck would you do that?! And so what?’</em>. She put the knife back on the table and stepped towards him.</p>\n<p><em>‘I saw the notice from your office. They said you haven’t showed up in two weeks.’</em></p>\n<p>She was Numb. His legs were trembling.</p>\n<p><em>‘Vaidehi, you love me right?’</em></p>\n<p><em>‘Yes’</em>, her lips were straight.</p>\n<p>He went straight to bed. Later that morning he woke up, to find himself alone. She was gone with Gayatri. The knife had cut real deep. It was a bloody mess. He fainted.</p>\n<p>“What type of a person you are! That woman had no love for you, but why are you still doing this for her? Just go home already.”</p>\n<p>The thick rope got around his neck. Eyes closed, hood on, memories started flashing in. And then came the regret, the regret that he would have loved Gayatri more, both of them.</p>","timeToRead":5}},{"node":{"id":"86ec97cd-047c-576f-9c8e-65006e253a0f","frontmatter":{"categories":["Non-Tech"],"date":"Jan 2017","draft":false,"slug":"/blog/handwash-to-lamp","subtitle":"","summary":"","title":"For a handwash from a lamp, A Short Love letter"},"html":"<p>My beloved,</p>\n<p>I still remember the day when you first came in this house.

Due to my recent interests in Image Processing, I had made <a href=\"https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3AOrkoHunter+is%3Aclosed\">few</a> Pull Requests to the <a href=\"https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image\">scikit-image</a> library, but it did not participate in GSoC. And that, after all those years of consecutive partcipation! (Yes I felt little sad.)</p>\n<p>So, the day when Google announced the list of organizations, I started my “org hunt” ! And by the end of the day, I had sorted out the Python-only projects, which included the project <a href=\"http://timelabtechnologies.com/ideas.html\">Library of Time Series methods</a>. The project was to make a library with methods useful to the research in X-ray astronomy. I was thrilled by the idea! Nevertheless, I was not much aware of the astronomical aspects of it.</p>\n<p>In next 10–15 days, I submitted my proposal and few Pull Requests, among which I think <a href=\"https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray/pull/74\">refactoring the Lightcurve class</a> helped me understand the core of the library. In the pre-GSoC period, I also contributed in establishing Continuous Integration with <a href=\"https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray/pull/51\">Travis</a> for Unix and <a href=\"https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray/pull/63\">Appveyor</a> for Windows. Meanwhile, Stingray, the library we were working on, was re-designed to become an <a href=\"https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray/pull/52\">Astropy affiliated package</a>.</p>\n<p>In the wee hours of April 23, the results were announced and I <em>was</em> <a href=\"https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5755858201870336\">selected</a>!

The main medium of the communication between my mentors and me was Slack. And I must say, we totally loved it.</p>\n<p>I started off with implementing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-spectrum\">Cross Spectra</a>, basing to a lot of work that was previously done by <a href=\"https://github.com/abigailStev\">Abigail Stevens</a>. Later on, Coherence and Lags were added in the Crossspectrum class, along with their tests and docstring.</p>\n<p>After the mid-terms the major work was to add the Covariance spectra, and its “Averaged” counter part as well, along with errors for both. My final PR was to add the simple matrix of Dynamical Powerspectrum, which is open as of now.</p>\n<p>Throughout this period, I was able to open <a href=\"https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3AOrkoHunter+is%3Aclosed\">22 Pull requests</a> and push <a href=\"https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray/commits/master?author=OrkoHunter\">116 commits</a> to the main repository <em>i.e.</em> StingraySoftware/Stingray.</p>\n<p>One thing that I would like to share, of many things which I learnt in this perioid, is that numpy booleans are little tricky. For e.g.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">In []: np.isfinite(100) is True\nOut[]: False</code></pre></div>\n<p>This is because np.isfinite or similar functions do not return the basic Python bool but an instance of numpy bool. And in the __eq__ magic method of the numpy bool class, it is evaluated to the Python booleans. And so, <code class=\"language-text\">np.isfinite(100) == True</code> would return True.</p>\n<p>That is all for now. It was a great experience for me, and I am very thankful to Daniela, Matteo and Abigail for all the help during the summer.</p>\n<p>Cheers!</p>","timeToRead":3}},{"node":{"id":"39af5725-6280-5330-b8ab-c2c00e20187e","frontmatter":{"categories":["Tech"],"date":"Jan 2017","draft":false,"slug":"/blog/losing-and-regaining-truct-on-gitignore","subtitle":"","summary":"","title":"Losing and Re-Gaining trust on .gitignore"},"html":"<p>I would like to share an interesting story of a problem which I’ve faced many times since I started using git.

I wasn’t supposed to push the pyc</em> files. Oh this looks so lame.</p>\n<p>If you’re amateur enough, not to feel uncomfortable after pushing those files, you’re golden. Else, you’ll think of something called .gitignore which helps in ignoring unwanted files to be added in your git repository.</p>\n<p>You’ll then search for a good gitignore file for Python and Google will give you exactly what you want, <a href=\"https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Python.gitignore\">Python.gitignore</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">wget -O .gitignore https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/master/Python.gitignore\ngit add -A\ngit commit -m \"Added .gitignore file\"</code></pre></div>\n<p>Now, you’ll try to remove the pyc files, using rm -rf *.pyc. But as soon as you'll do this, (and if you're using oh-my-zsh), you'll see a cross on your prompt. That means, git has <em>detected</em> a change.</p>\n<p><em>But wait? Why is git detecting changes to pyc files, when I’ve already added the gitignore!</em></p>\n<p>Now, if you’re me, you’ll feel betrayed by git.

So, if you’ll remove the staged file (pyc files, in this case), git will say to you that you’ve deleted them.</p>\n<p>Later on, I googled the string “gitignore not working” and O thanks to stackoverflow, I was rescued.</p>\n<p>After adding the .gitignore, simply do this</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">git rm -rf --cached .\ngit add .</code></pre></div>\n<p>Or, instead of <code class=\"language-text\">rm -rf *.pyc</code></p>\n<p>, I must have done</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">git rm -rf *.pyc</code></p>\n<p>Ta-da !

They are not mere text editors. They have built-in code to edit any external code. Isn’t that pretty? Well, you have to follow some steps to close it.

As of me, I survived a whole semester of college with <a href=\"http://blog.orkohunter.net/touchpad-problem-with-asus-laptop-on-linux/\">my touchpad not working</a>. But that doesn’t mean I moved to emacs or vim. subl to open, pgup pgdn and arrow keys for navigation, ctrl + s to save, ctrl + t for new tab, I mean I had got everything done with my keyboard and the fact is that Chrome also obeys these commands (or vice-versa). Imagine you scrolling through a webpage and wondering why j and k are not helping you.</p>\n<p>The point I’m trying to make is why shouldn’t we encourage newbies to use the editor which makes their life really easy very fast so that they could simply learn how to code rather then learning how to code to code. Later on, let them decide whether they really dislike this editor and move on to something more challenging and I believe some people will surely move on to the challenging ones.</p>\n<p>But I will surely not.
