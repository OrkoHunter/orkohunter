Raymond</a> on various (open source) software development methods. The wikipedia page for the book in short, lists few important lessons that he learned and they can not be more true.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer’s personal itch.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to rewrite (and reuse).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Plan to throw one [version] away; you will, anyhow. (Copied from Frederick Brooks’ <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_S._Raymond\">The Mythical Man-Month</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you have the right attitude, interesting problems will find you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When you lose interest in a program, your last duty to it is to hand it off to a competent successor.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Treating your users as co-developers is your least-hassle route to rapid code improvement and effective debugging.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Release_early,_release_often\">Release early. Release often.</a> And listen to your customers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Smart data structures and dumb code works a lot better than the other way around.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you treat your beta-testers as if they’re your most valuable resource, they will respond by becoming your most valuable resource.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The next best thing to having good ideas is recognizing good ideas from your users. Sometimes the latter is better.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Often, the most striking and innovative solutions come from realizing that your concept of the problem was wrong.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Perfection (in design) is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but rather when there is nothing more to take away. (Attributed to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_de_Saint-Exup%C3%A9ry\">Antoine de Saint-Exupéry</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Any tool should be useful in the expected way, but a truly great tool lends itself to uses you never expected.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When writing gateway software of any kind, take pains to disturb the data stream as little as possible — and never throw away information unless the recipient forces you to!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When your language is nowhere near Turing-complete, syntactic sugar can be your friend.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A security system is only as secure as its secret. Beware of pseudo-secrets.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To solve an interesting problem, start by finding a problem that is interesting to you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Provided the development coordinator has a communications medium at least as good as the Internet, and knows how to lead without coercion, many heads are inevitably better than one.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar#Lessons_for_creating_good_open_source_software\"><em>Attribution</em></a></p>\n<hr>\n<p>These lessons are really something to be read periodically while developing and contributing to open source software. They are worth noting down and sharing.</p>","timeToRead":2,"frontmatter":{"categories":["Tech"],"date":"Mar 20, 2017","draft":false,"slug":"/blog/lessons-open-source","subtitle":"","summary":"","title":"Lessons for creating good open source software","image":{"childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"src":"/static/2363fab529212dc4273472084aab9a47/497c6/tree.png"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"id":"fb980ac5-cfb7-5b6e-8aa4-cc301d90e154","frontmatter__slug":"/blog/lessons-open-source","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"blog"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["764694655"]}
