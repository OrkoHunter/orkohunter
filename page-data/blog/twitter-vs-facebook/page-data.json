It is good to note that the default setting of Facebook is to be private with posts and Twitter to be open to the web. While managing the Facebook and Twitter account of an organization I am involved in, I noticed a serious design pattern involved in displaying the public posts and their stark differences.</p>\n<h2 id=\"case-1-stages-of-interacting-with-twitter\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#case-1-stages-of-interacting-with-twitter\" aria-label=\"case 1 stages of interacting with twitter permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Case 1: Stages of interacting with Twitter</h2>\n<p>If you open a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kossiitkgp/status/954776125573554176\">public tweet</a> in incognito mode, or while being logged out, you’ll land on something like this —</p>\n<p><img src=\"./1*jYcPCOlsEVbI7WL7oEhE9A.png\" alt=\"Picture of a tweet\"></p>\n<p><strong>Stage 1</strong> of interaction consists of the <em>content of the tweet</em> with the highest visibility, followed by who created the tweet, then more details about the tweet. At this point of time, there is no available “Sign Up” button to be clicked. You can now easily close the tab since most of the times, your purpose would be the information contained in the tweet.</p>\n<p>But if you feel engaged and you click on the close button on the top right corner, you’ll land on the profile page of the account which created the tweet, which I call the <strong>Stage 2.</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"./twitter_profile.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>You can see that the majority percentage of the web page is covered with the profile information. On the sidebar and header, there are interactive elements which lead you to sign up on the platform. And you would do, if you seem impressed. Let’s have a look at Facebook.</p>\n<h2 id=\"case-2-stages-of-interacting-with-a-public-post-on-facebook\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#case-2-stages-of-interacting-with-a-public-post-on-facebook\" aria-label=\"case 2 stages of interacting with a public post on facebook permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Case 2: Stages of interacting with a public post on Facebook</h2>\n<p>If you open a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/kossiitkgp/photos/a.551030724973932.1073741826.524856034258068/1588200897923571/\">public post</a> on Facebook, you land on something like this —</p>\n<p><img src=\"./1*-sIjEoUp6WckYnrziAf_KQ.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>It’s interesting to notice that much more than half of the area is covered with <strong>ways to either join or log in to Facebook</strong>. And the Stage 1 has <em>zero</em> information about the post (which was the sole purpose of opening that particular URL). The only way to close this banner is to find that tiny <em>Not Now</em> text below the big Green <em>Create New Account</em>. An interesting design flaw (whether intentional or by mistake) is that the typography of <em>Not Now</em> and <em>Forgotten Account?</em> is exactly the same, even when the later button is clicked once a hundred times and the former 99 out of 100 times. I think it’s intentional.</p>\n<p>Let’s click on <em>Not Now</em>, and move the <strong>Stage 2</strong> of the view.</p>\n<p><img src=\"./1*DjkjiZQ7_yC_IADORFLO_Q.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>On this webpage, the area covered with the information about the post is still comparable or maybe less than the <em>engageble area of log in and sign up</em>.

Even if both the products want users, Facebook is <strong>desperately user-hungry</strong> in public.</p>\n<p>— Content is not respected on Facebook while Twitter values the content over anything else. Eventually content dies out on Facebook while people keep retweeting and referring 5 year old tweets.</p>\n<p><em>Thank you for reading.
