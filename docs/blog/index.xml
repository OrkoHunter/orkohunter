      <description>During my JEE preparations, I used to make a lot of notes. Everyone did. Our Physics teacher was a storyteller. His stories used to make me wonder. I used to write them down as well.
I studied for two years. Thus, it was very important to write things down and keep revising. It was impossible to remember the lessons we learnt, without making good notes. My academic journey is about to end with my graduation.</description>

      <description>After a long time, I read something so meaningful on reddit. How do you distinguish genuine love for someone from infatuation? was the question.
And I want to quote what I read and later express some of my thoughts on the subject. Here is the original comment.
 This is a good question.
  &amp;hellip; It’s really easy to confuse it with genuine love. But for me anyway, infatuation is a lot more like a drug.</description>

तुम्हारे दिल में अभी
और तरंगें बजने को हैं न !

      <description>“You’re an interesting species. An interesting mix. You’re capable of such beautiful dreams, and such horrible nightmares. You feel so lost, so cut off, so alone, only you’re not. See, in all our searching, the only thing we’ve found that makes the emptiness bearable, is each other.” — Carl Sagan
 I always wonder when I listen to this quote in the song Doves by We Are All Astronauts.</description>

      <description>IS THIS EVEN POSSIBLE?
 Well, Yeah.
 BUT YOU PROBABLY NEED TO BE A DC ADMIN TO GET THIS, NO?
 Nope. Anyone can do it.
 Holy Schnikes!!!! TELL ME HOW TO DO IT ON DC++!!
 Lol, come to Linux already!
 Note: I shall not be giving out a one-click solution to monitor DC searches intentionally even if it were possible. But if you are dedicated enough, you can figure things out by reading it.</description>

      <description>Layers of ‘I’ when perceiving anything which is external to it
 Thanks to Montaigne, one of the first essay writers, for popularizing this literary genre. As the title suggests, I have had many musings upon the similarity and the differences of these three entities which can be thought as a subset of ‘I’ and which have very diffused boundaries among their definitions.

      <description>After letting Facebook Inc. build a vast profile of me for 9 years, I deleted my facebook account. Privacy is not my only concern, but I personally reacted to how Facebook has affected the way we interact in our real life.
How?   Downloaded a copy of my data from facebook -&amp;gt; settings This contained all of my messages, photos, videos, and probably a lot more information which I can not consciously recall sharing with Facebook.</description>

      <description>It’s the dawn of the 20th century. If we pick two homo sapiens on earth, we can classify their relationship as one of these three types:
 An Acquaintance (Both of them are acquainted with each other) Unfamiliarity (No one knows about the existence of other) Celebrity status (One of the two is famous)  Today is the dawn of the 21st century. And every day in my college I meet few people who fall in none of the three types.</description>

      <description>What design tells you about the company’s values
 Both Facebook and Twitter allow posts to be publicly accessible by people who have not joined the platform. It is good to note that the default setting of Facebook is to be private with posts and Twitter to be open to the web. While managing the Facebook and Twitter account of an organization I am involved in, I noticed a serious design pattern involved in displaying the public posts and their stark differences.</description>

      <description>You may listen to this while reading We Are All Astronauts - Ether (YouTube).
Few months ago, a significant percentage of my peers were involved in the process of getting a job or an internship, including me. Some got the success while some are still trying. But to my astonishment, I found that the degree of comfort in each one of them was not as expected. What I mean by that is, not everyone who got this success was happy, and not everyone who failed was sad, although the majority was skewed on the side of the former case.</description>

      <description>I was reading about The Cathedral and the Bazaar, a book by Eric S. Raymond on various (open source) software development methods. The wikipedia page for the book in short, lists few important lessons that he learned and they can not be more true.
  Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer’s personal itch.
  Good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to rewrite (and reuse).</description>

      <description>Watch this video from Nerdwriter1 Let&amp;rsquo;s Fix Instagram (YouTube).
Instagram is Facebook, but only with a different purpose than connecting people, it’s about sharing photos. Photos are great, they convey art, beauty and literature in its own form. And that is what attracted Instagram to so many users. But the problem started when, we applied our *minds to it.
What Instagram should never be about   Sharing pictures with your face in it Couple years ago, if you had clicked a great picture of yours and you wanted to share it among your friends (people who know you), you’d usually go to Facebook and then share it over there.</description>

Next, choose unlimited personal repositories for free. In the final step you can give some input to github and voila ! You are now a github user. (If you are redirect from KWoC, use the username there.) There is plethora of git guides over internet, some are really good and some really suck.</description>

न जाने मेरा हाथ क्यों न थामाँ उसने
उसे गहराइयों की सुकूँ भाती चली गयी ।

I still remember the day when you first came in this house. You were inside the groceries bag which was kept on the floor right near my table. Ah! 36 aayi, 36 gayi but I never saw anyone like you. Your lean appearance, your light pink complexion and above of all, your aroma all blew up my mind. It took me only 8.2 seconds to realise that I was in love with you!</description>

So, the day when Google announced the list of organizations, I started my “org hunt” ! And by the end of the day, I had sorted out the Python-only projects, which included the project Library of Time Series methods.</description>

I usually lose my temper studying my other subjects like Environmental Science, Biology and Economics. For how long will I have to study “everything”. Sigh.
So, I either eat or surf the web when I’m not studying. That’s pretty much it.</description>

‘I use sublime text’, is often misunderstood as ‘I am a novice and I don’t like pure black window’. There is no way this 7 years old editor is going to compete with 39 years old emacs and 15 years old fork of yet another 39 years old editor vi. Nevertheless, there’s much more to come.</description>

      <description>Dedicated to all the nameless young girls out there in our villages
आज वर्षों बाद, रानी अपने मायके जा रही थी । ट्रेक्टर (गाड़ी) पर सवार , उसके साथ की औरतों को बड़ी अनूठी लग रही थी उसका बाहरी सजावट । भला एक हाथ में तीन चूड़ियां कोई पहनता है क्या ! इसकी माँ ने इसे बताया नहीं कितना अशुभ होता है । दुसरे में चार थीं, दो लाल, एक पीली और एक हरे रंग की ।</description>
