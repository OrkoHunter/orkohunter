Aldous Huxley wrote a dystopian classic called Brave New World, which is contemporary to 1984 and has a similar literary significance. Although Huxley is slightly less familiar, I have come to realize.\nBoth Huxley and Orwell talked about dyspotian futures. Although the path leading up to their fearful vision of world were treaded from different ends.\n\u0026ldquo;What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no-one who wanted to read one.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egotism.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;In 1984, people are controlled by inflicting pain. In Brave New World, they are controlled by inflicting pleasure.\u0026rdquo;, writes Neil Postman.\nReading this with the context of Social Media and News in our present world, we are so much closer to the world Huxley envisioned almost hundred years ago.\nHowever, this blog post isn\u0026rsquo;t about dystopia. I want to talk a bit about this other masterpiece Huxley wrote called \u0026ldquo;The Doors of Perception\u0026rdquo;. It is a tiny book, just about 30 pages; but is top shelf for me.\nThe Doors of Perception Huxley says that no two human beings have the same perception of the world. We perceive things around us uniquely. For example, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter how close we feel to a person, let it be our partner, a close friend of ours or our parents - each of our perceptions will always be different. And it gets interesting if you think more about it.\n\u0026ldquo;We live together, we act on, and react to, one another; but always and in all circumstances we are by ourselves. The martyrs go hand in hand into the arena; they are crucified alone. Embraced, the lovers desperately try to fuse their insulated ecstasies into a single self-transcendence; in vain. By its very nature every embodied spirit is doomed to suffer and enjoy in solitude. Sensations, feelings, insights, fancies - all these are private and, except through symbols and at second hand, incommunicable. We can pool information about experiences, but never the experiences themselves. From family to nation, every human group is a society of island universes\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;, says Huxley in this book.\nReality If someone asks me - what do you mean by reality? I\u0026rsquo;ll say, well, you know the trees grow, flowers bloom, we live on planet Earth, which is round, human beings experience pain and suffering, gravity exists - and the other things that I see in the world.\nIn my answer, I only mentioned what is easy for me to say, and can be agreed upon by a lot of people - hopefully everyone. But my complete reality is much larger and has edges which get a bit fuzzier. And I have not grown enough to describe them well, I think. I probably never will.\n \u0026ldquo;What we ordinarily call \u0026ldquo;reality\u0026rdquo; is merely that slice of total fact which our biological equipment, our linguistic heritage and our social conventions of thought and feeling make it possible for us to apprehend.\u0026rdquo;\n These words of Huxley are painful to read at times. He basically suggests that we\u0026rsquo;ll never know the absolute reality even if it exists. The tool that helps us cut this \u0026ldquo;slice\u0026rdquo; is called Perception.\nBut the good news is that our perceptions change, or rather expand. And we get to see more of it as we grow.\nExperiences Huxley says that for each of us, there are many perceptions which we can not access. Their doors are locked for us. For example, if you never given birth, you can still talk about parenting but there is so much more still locked for you. And you\u0026rsquo;ll get to unlock that door only when you will raise a child.\nHe says that we are caged inside our perceptions, and that there are doors which lead us to new realities. But so far we have opened only a handful of them. And majority of doors are still locked for us - and that too from outside - so it\u0026rsquo;s not possible for us to go and see what\u0026rsquo;s on the other side merely by thinking.\nIt takes experiences - or rather \u0026ldquo;meaningful experiences\u0026rdquo; to unlock these doors.\nCommunication My university campus was beautiful. The trees and the shades of green always blew my mind. Taking frequent walks in the day was one of my favorite activities. For a few years, I thought everyone around me knew it - just because it was obvious for me.\nAfter reading Huxley and The Doors of Perception, I entered a brief but gloomy phase in life. He basically gave me some uncomfortable realizations that I had to live with. No matter how much I love my parents or my partner, they will never get to know it all. A part of me was getting sadder with more experiences I was having one by one. And it was getting harder for me to communicate everything I felt. I was naive.\nYears have passed and I have made peace with this limitation of life. We can not communicate everything, but we can try! Since then, I started putting more effort into the ways I communicate. Sometimes I speak, write poems, draw analogies from stories - and sometimes I would just send someone a song. I have made peace with the fact that everything can not be conveyed with language. Some things need to be heard, seen and felt.\nSame goes for taking pictures. Don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong - I think photos are a great way of communicating. But sometimes I respect a view, by not taking a picture. How would you feel if someone took a favorite song of yours, and sang it poorly and offbeat? The same goes for me when I try to capture extraordinary beauty of nature in pixels. It usually happens with mountains, forests, oceans, etc.\nArt is an attempt to communicate Art (poetry, music, paintings etc.) are beautiful attempts by human beings to convey their perceptions. Even though I will never get to think about music, the way David Gilmour of Pink Floyd did. I will never get to think about world, the way Aldous Huxley did. I will never look at the stars in the sky, the way Van Gogh did. But their music, writings and paintings hints me of a larger reality.\nConclusion Realizing that the true nature of reality is beyond our comprehension and that we\u0026rsquo;ll always be cutting slices of it, can be a humbling feeling. It can inspire us to keep expanding our perceptions - by have more meaningful experiences in life.\n","date":1626566400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1626566400,"objectID":"dd98d7ba4df0280990c0ccd6910bab5f","permalink":"https://orkohunter.net/blog/huxleys-world-of-perceptions/","publishdate":"2021-07-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/huxleys-world-of-perceptions/","section":"blog","summary":"What we ordinarily call reality, is merely that slice of total fact which our biological equipment, our linguistic heritage and our social conventions of thought and feeling make it possible for us to apprehend.","tags":null,"title":"Aldous Huxley's world of perceptions","type":"blog"},{"authors":null,"categories":["notes"],"content":"Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qHkcs3kG44 (Lots and lots of wisdom here.

On one side there are scientists, researchers, billions of dollars of creating addiction machines (Media, Technology, Food) vs You. And you are alone in this fight. A short clip here with sketches from After Skool https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqlfWDyS1Io\nI would rather read 100 books over and over again, rather than read all the books. We have a finite memory.\nWe have been automating and eliminating jobs since forever (like when Electricity was invented). We don\u0026rsquo;t lose jobs, we start doing only the most creative jobs. The ideal world is where there are only creative jobs, and all non-creative jobs will be automated by machines. e.g. Identifying problems and thinking about solutions in a specialized field is a creative job.

Thanks to programs like Google Summer of Code who have seriously changed the lives of many and introduced hundreds of thousands of young students to Open Source programming.\nHowever, this number is small in the grand scheme of things.\nIf I have to make a guess, out of all the students who graduate and start their career around Software (including Data Science, Machine Learning, etc.), less than 10% would ever contribute to any Open Source projects. And even less would do so for an extended period of time.\nIn this blog post, I am writing down some reflections. I am highlighting few major reasons why I feel open source contributions are helpful. And the benefits are extraordinary.\nYou learn so much more Almost all of your Pull Requests will be reviewed by other people. In a healthy open source community, maintainers spend a big chunk of their time reviewing incoming Pull Requests. There are many times when review comments leave me in awe - and I am filled with gratitude. The reviewer wants to have good quality code in the software, but in effect of that, you learn so much more from their insights and experience.\nIdeally, this is one of the those experiences you may get in your internships and first few jobs. But what are the chances of you ending up in such a team? And even if you get one helpful mentor, that\u0026rsquo;s just one. If you stay in Open Source communities, you are constantly learning from numerous of those, and not just in summer for a period of three months.\nOur ways of doing software are heavily biased on the first projects we get involved with. We copy over the ideas to the future, since we know they have worked well. Exposure to multiple Open Source projects break that bias, and exposes us to other newer ways of creating Software.\nI have seen many issues on GitHub describing a problem that seems extremely hard to solve. And when GitHub says, this issue got closed by this specific Pull Request - I feel spoiled that I get to see what that Pull Request did. To have public access to such knowledge is a gift to this community.\nNot everyone studies Computer Science in college. And even if they do, their Software Engineering courses are either missing or outdated to the current day and age. MIT launched a course called - \u0026ldquo;The Missing Semester of Your CS Education\u0026rdquo; to address this problem. Computer Science and Software Engineering have grown so much now, that it\u0026rsquo;s impossible to teach both of them in a single curriculum. And the subjects have diverged - It has become Theory vs Practicality, Research vs Industry. Not all but most CS Professors are much closer to the research than the industry, and they expect students to do Open Source projects and internships on their own to gain the industry experience.\nLast but not least, a vast majority of Open Source work is done remote, over the internet, with strangers. The skills required to carry on a remote work become fundamental necessities - good written communication is one of many.\nYou escape the privilege barrier In India, more than a million students graduate engineering courses every year. Every other job extended in my college placement season was somehow related to programming. This number gets higher with the several tiers of colleges. I imagine an average good Software Company would get a headcount of 10 new-grad engineers, to hire from the world.\nThese numbers break my heart. Not everyone gets the chance to experience joy and growth in their career.\nOpen Source is small but a beam of hope for these students. Google Summer of Code doesn\u0026rsquo;t look at your IIT JEE rank for you to participate in it. Maintainers don\u0026rsquo;t look at what Department or college you study in, before answering your questions. All these nonsensical privilege barriers do not exist in your way to improve yourself and learn.\nYou become a volunteer Open Source contribution was my first exposure of volunteering and belongingness to a community. Not everything needs to be paid in money. I started seeing the return value in terms of learning, joy of accomplishing something, or just doing something together with people.\nI was part of a college group which helps college students learn more about Open Source. Looking back, I see that a lot of Open Source contributors follow the idea that - Knowledge should be shared. They start helping out people for no apparent reasons. Well mainly because someone else helped them in their journey and they want to continue the tradition.\nThis feeling of volunteering (somewhat altruism) in Open Source still impresses me and others. The idea of non-monetary benefits in work is strange to a majority of people I have met professionally.\nToxic competitions are not for everyone You might already know that college admission exams are highly competitive. One wants to get into the best college. One wants to study in the best department. One wants to score the highest grades. One wants to get Gold medals in the online competitive events.\nIt easily gets toxic for some people. It changes the perception of their social life. Even when talking to friends, they think of things they know more of - due to their performances in previous competitions.\nI haven\u0026rsquo;t seen that much competition when it comes to Open Source contributions. People help each other a lot more than trying to get ahead in some kind of race.\nYou might fall in love with Software Richard Feynman has said - \u0026ldquo;If you find science boring, you\u0026rsquo;re learning it from a wrong teacher.\u0026quot;\nI feel the same for programming. Students may not like the complexity of a doubly linked list written in C, but might enjoy Python\u0026rsquo;s 10 lines of code for their web server. Sure a lot of people like writing Software, but not everyone \u0026ldquo;loves\u0026rdquo; to do it for their career.\nIn contrast of only working with a handful of internship projects, working on many well designed Open Source software increase our chances of falling in love with it. And it helps.\nThank you for reading! \u0026lt;3\n","date":1608336000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1608336000,"objectID":"8dac7ff547d6bbc235a0a476ae658050","permalink":"https://orkohunter.net/blog/why-do-open-source-in-college/","publishdate":"2020-12-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/why-do-open-source-in-college/","section":"blog","summary":"If you are planning to stay close to Software after graduation, this article might win you over to do Open Source.","tags":null,"title":"Why should one do Open Source in college?","type":"blog"},{"authors":null,"categories":["podcast"],"content":"Links  Youtube Spotify Google Podcasts  ","date":1606435200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606435200,"objectID":"9934e06b54f371ae71ec02abe046aaf3","permalink":"https://orkohunter.net/podcast/harsh-gupta/","publishdate":"2020-11-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/podcast/harsh-gupta/","section":"podcast","summary":"Links  Youtube Spotify Google Podcasts  ","tags":null,"title":"#3 | Harsh Gupta","type":"podcast"},{"authors":null,"categories":["podcast"],"content":"Links  Youtube Spotify Google Podcasts  ","date":1600646400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600646400,"objectID":"fdda0b1657dd4ed5c75a2a95c6490646","permalink":"https://orkohunter.net/podcast/anish-raj/","publishdate":"2020-09-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/podcast/anish-raj/","section":"podcast","summary":"Links  Youtube Spotify Google Podcasts  ","tags":null,"title":"#2 | Anish Raj","type":"podcast"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Tech","Non-Tech"],"content":"I first heard the phrase \u0026ldquo;Live Asynchronously\u0026rdquo; in this article written by the amazing Quincy Larson, the creator of freecodecamp.org.\nIn my last blog post about Joining Spotify in Sweden, I wrote a bit about this. Here, I have written more about what living asynchronously means to me. I have put some concrete examples from life where I have used this philosophy.\nDefine Asynchronous I have understood Asynchronous in programming but Asynchrony has more (similiar) meanings.\nIn my earliest days with Javascript, I remember being stuck one time. In my program I was doing an API request. Irrespective of whether the request was successful, my variable to store the API response was always undefined. I was in my first year of college and I expressed my frustration to my brother with \u0026ldquo;Javascript sucks\u0026rdquo;. All he said was \u0026ldquo;Remember, Javascript is asynchronous.\u0026quot; And that fixed the issue! I still see such problems and they get fixed by the Remember\u0026hellip;\nMost of the beginners face this problem with Javascript in their early days because Javascript is async in nature. This is unlike Python, which is a imperative (procedural) language.\nDifference Let us take this short example of a program to understand the difference.\n 1. Say \u0026quot;Hello World\u0026quot;. 2. *API request to fetch an image from the internet. 3. Based on the response of the request, store the image. 4. Calculate 1 + 1. In a procedural language like Python or C/C++, all the 4 lines will be executed one after the other. The lines 3 and 4 will be executed only when line 2 has completely finished (network request has completed). But, it could take a second or more to complete that request.\nOur program will spend most of its time at line 2 waiting for the network request to finish.\n.\nBut, in an asynchronous language like Javascript, we will write the program differently.\n 1. Say \u0026quot;Hello World\u0026quot;. 2. *API request to fetch an image from the internet. 3. (Callback) Based on the response of the network request, store the image. 4. Calculate 1 + 1. Here, line 1 will be executed as usual. In line 2, we will do the API request. But, this time we are not going to wait around for the response. We will immediately move on to Line 4 and execute it. When the network call in line 2 finishes, we will execute the \u0026ldquo;callback\u0026rdquo; assigned to it in line 3.\nConclusion Asynchronous programming comes into the picture for the blocks of code which take significant time to execute i.e. something which blocks the procedural execution of the main program.\nSending an internet request, reading/writing to a file or a database takes way more time than calculating 1 + 1. So, we write a \u0026ldquo;callback function\u0026rdquo; for our asynchronous block of code. The callback decides what to do when the network request or the I/O operation completes.\nPromise in Javascript has the same philosophy and is more powerful than callbacks.\nThe Philosophy Humans and computers function in an extraordinarily similar fashion. The I/O (Input/Output) operation for a computer is to talk to other computers. The I/O operation for us is to talk to other people.\nThis blocks the main program. It means there is a chunk of time that it takes away from the main program for as long as the blocking execution is being done.\nThese I/O operations are necessary for us to survive and communicate. They happen frequently and are also time-consuming. It then becomes important for us to manage them well.\nLiving Asynchronously is us making sure our I/O operations are asynchronous most of the time.\nApplying the philosophy Year 2004 Age 7 I remember in my school, our Maths textbooks used to have many questions in the form of exercises. An exercise was a collection of questions on one topic. There used to be dozens of chapters and hundreds of exercises in a book. The year-long school curriculum and timeline were to make sure all the chapters and their exercises get completed by the students.\nGenerally, the entire batch of students is synchronised on what exercise they are doing. Let\u0026rsquo;s say the teacher decides that this week, we are going to complete the Exercise 21 based on the basic Trigonometric formulae. By Monday next week, It is expected of the students to have their notebooks up-to-date. That\u0026rsquo;s how synchronous programming works.\nThis model is not great. Not everyone in the class needs to follow the pace set by the teacher for what they deem is suitable for the class.\nWhen I was in the 3rd standard (age 7), my father started teaching Maths to my elder brother and me. (Fun fact: All three of us now do programming for a living!). It was 2004. In the summer before the school would begin, dad had set the target for me to solve all the problems in the book I was going to study that year. I loved the experience! Although it took a lot of time from my summer vacation, it was rewarding. And I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to stop there. Dad noticed this and bought me the maths textbooks for the following years. And this went on until in the 7th standard, I was doing the problems of the Maths book used in the 10th class.\nIf I had followed the synchronous philosophy of the school, I would have to sit around throughout the year, learning not much new. A decade after that time, I would consciously start living asynchronously.\nWorking in college societies Back in college, for five years I was part of a literary society and a club to promote open source. These were two separate groups and I was an active member of both! In my 3rd/4th year, I was part of the so called \u0026ldquo;executive batch\u0026rdquo;. We were 4-5 people responsible to execute the events organized by 30-50 of us members, for the hundreds of students on campus to attend.\nBefore we organized any event (a poetry night, an open mic, a Python or a GSoC workshop, etc.), I as the organizer needed to sync with all the members helping out. There are many operations that need to be taken care of, like logistics, publicity, poster distribution, members' performances/talks, communication with external members, finances, etc. If I remember correctly, I had burnt out early in the year. I had to sync with so many people during the days of the actual event. I valued the event\u0026rsquo;s success not much by its attendance, but a lot by how we did it and the things we learned in the process.\nLets take the task of poster distribution. The job was to print a bunch of posters for the event that had its details, description, contact, venue, time, etc. and paste it across the college campus so that other students would notice. From the team, I would assign one person to take care of this. This meant that they were responsible for going to the printing press, getting the copies done, and then with the help of other members, putting them up across the campus. Given I had other equally important tasks to take care of, it was a nightmare to contact all the people involved in this particular task. But, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t just \u0026ldquo;assign and forget\u0026rdquo; the task to someone because, if he or she decided to slack off, it would disrupt the event. This has happened quite many times as I remember. So, I started identifying people I could trust, who shared the passion of the work and cared. And then, living asynchronously was easy and the only sane way to go about it.\nThen on, all my instructions and tasks had their callbacks. And if someone else asked me to do something, I would ask them to write their callback i.e. tell me what to do when I\u0026rsquo;m done with this. I reduced many unnecessary \u0026ldquo;blocking\u0026rdquo; I/O operations from my life, resulting in a much relaxed life.\nWhatsApp message \u0026ldquo;seen\u0026rdquo; tick Many years ago Facebook started showing things like \u0026ldquo;message seen at 10:10 AM\u0026rdquo; in their chatbox. This was the first time I saw something like this. Earlier, messaging someone was much like sending a very short email - you didn\u0026rsquo;t expect a response within a minute. Instant communication started catching up and now there is a product called \u0026ldquo;mail tracker\u0026rdquo; which tells you when and how many times your email was read.\nI have disabled the blue seen tick in WhatsApp and I have a dummy facebook account. This means, I don\u0026rsquo;t get to know when my message was read and the other person doesn\u0026rsquo;t know when I read their message. This is me, trying to reduce \u0026ldquo;synchronous\u0026rdquo; communication from life, as it introduces more problems than it solves.\nIf someone sees my message, I never ought to expect an instant response. I have no idea what they are doing in their \u0026ldquo;main program\u0026rdquo;. They could be in a thought process, talking with someone else, working on something, or be in one of a thousand different possibilities. So \u0026ldquo;seen at 10:10 AM\u0026rdquo; gives me no information. It instead triggers me to think - why have they not replied yet.\nIf I want to have a synchronous conversation, I would set up a call at the convenience of both of us. That is much efficient in every aspect. By not having to worry about replying instantly and not expecting someone to do so, I have freed a lot of time that I used to waste in waiting for the response.\nRelationships and Behaviour If I have the freedom of my thoughts, asynchrony is associated with freedom.\nIf our actions and words demand synchronous response from the other person, it directly impacts their time. It affects how they want to spend it. Doing it way often is not nice. And it is a kind gesture to respect their time and do less synchronous communication. Allowing someone to be free is a great expression of love and it makes us better humans.\nI would be crazy to say that all synchronous communications are bad. That would be insane. What I do is reduce the frequency, and increase the time to generate more value. And of course, do lots of async stuff. :)\nBlog post vs Notifications A blog post is a shining example of communicating asynchronously in this world.\nThis blog post does not demand anything from you. You can close it as soon as you opened it, read it now, a week later or next year. I have no expectation of knowing whether you read it or not, unless you want to let me know. I enjoy writing and reading them. They do not feel \u0026ldquo;instant\u0026rdquo;. They do not say \u0026ldquo;just now\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;posted a minute ago\u0026rdquo;. As Quincy Larson says - all notifications are synchronous. Social media wants to notify me if someone has said something publicly. Facebook/Instagram/Twitter wants to keep me in \u0026ldquo;sync\u0026rdquo; with what all my friends are doing. However, this blog post will sit here on this website. And if someone wants to see if I have written something new, it will be discovered.\nIronically, I am going to tweet a link to this blog post. That will be synchronous. Oh, the hippocracy! ;)\nRemote work promotes living asynchronously Before my first job started, I was convinced that by introducing more asynchrony in life, I am saving my time and energy and I am being happier. When I started working, I had the challenge of adopting the same philosophy at work. I knew it would be challenging because people have their own style of working. But I tried my best to keep this philosophy alive with me.\nIf I would have technical queries to ask, most of them would be Email or Slack and few in-person. As I understood the team and the technologies better over time, I would change all my questions to being asynchronous. That kept everyone involved a bit happier. The person who\u0026rsquo;d write the answer, would do so in their free time. Hence the responses had more details and helped me more than what a disrupting synchronous question would have done.\nWhen a project is newborn, synchronous communication between the stakeholders and engineers is necessary and valuable. They help avoid confusion and misunderstandings. But as the tasks start being granular, sync-meetings begin losing their value.\nIf a project has grown large and has no documentation, there is no way asynchronous communication is possible even after months or years. The few people who created it, are going to waste more time answering questions, which they should have written in the form of documentation ages ago.\nGenerally, product managers love to talk about projects in team meetings. Why won\u0026rsquo;t they? They have a vision and want to share. But a wise engineering manager would come and ask, \u0026ldquo;Can this information be shared via an email?\u0026rdquo;. This is a smart question to ask each time because it not only promotes written documentation but saves time for the involved engineers. They got time to focus and pay more attention to the work, which would have been disrupted by a synchronous meeting.\nSimilar to blog posts, Documentation of projects and code is a light beam of hope in the asynchronous life. If I can find the documentation to read, it drastically reduces the amount of synchronous communication involved to solve my problem. And since a tap on the shoulder in not possible when working remotely, more written communication is the way to go!\nTLDR (Too long, didn\u0026rsquo;t read) Living Asynchronously is inspired by the concept of asynchronous programming and Javascript\u0026rsquo;s callbacks and promises. Synchronous life events are blocking in nature, are inefficient and time-consuming. It is not always possible, but living asynchronous life has its benefits and is a great way to live.\nI believe this philosophy is easy to understand and can be applied on many aspects of life. I encourage you to think on your own and identify the synchronous events in life. And then imagine how living asynchronously would feel.\n","date":1592697600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592697600,"objectID":"ce0b16a2b65916486222913db1c845ac","permalink":"https://orkohunter.net/blog/live-asynchronously/","publishdate":"2020-06-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/live-asynchronously/","section":"blog","summary":"Bringing the philosophy of asynchronous programming into life.","tags":null,"title":"Live Asynchronously","type":"blog"},{"authors":null,"categories":["podcast"],"content":"Links  Youtube Spotify Google Podcasts  ","date":1591488000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591488000,"objectID":"17462ed13b7b0d217777b2532594f3a0","permalink":"https://orkohunter.net/podcast/nishant-kgp-and-things/","publishdate":"2020-06-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/podcast/nishant-kgp-and-things/","section":"podcast","summary":"Links  Youtube Spotify Google Podcasts  ","tags":null,"title":"#1 | Nishant Nikhil - KGP and Things","type":"podcast"},{"authors":null,"categories":["letters"],"content":":name-retracted: wrote -  Hi Himanshu,\n  Congratulations from the bottom of my heart for joining Spotify. We really miss you at college. You\u0026rsquo;re one of the few seniors at KGP from whom I got really influenced in making changes in my life. I\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking of writing a letter to you since a few months as a chat/talk cannot convey the message with proper bandwidth. I wanted to talk about a lot of things. There isn\u0026rsquo;t a purpose per se. If there\u0026rsquo;s one thing I regret now that would be making myself away from you guys during my first year because of the intoxicated activities xD. I used to judge people blindly on the basis of their habits and think my parents are always right. As I grow up, I realise that not a single one has any idea of what they\u0026rsquo;re doing in their life, how things progress and end. Everyone learns from their experiences and they think if they could change a decision that they took in the past, they could\u0026rsquo;ve avoided some problems in the present but that would erase a lot of things they\u0026rsquo;ve gained from their problems. This statement came from a show that I\u0026rsquo;ve watched recently called Dark by Netflix. I\u0026rsquo;ve been reading a lot of psychology recently and I realised that everyone who I thought was doing good has a lot of insecurities and they keep doing things having faith in their values, finding happiness in their small wins after the hardships and it\u0026rsquo;s beautiful.\n  I\u0026rsquo;m getting confused a lot recently. I watched a show called Bojack Horseman and it was so depressing. Whenever I watch a single episode, I used to relate myself to the character who is a horse which always says things about life in a doomer way. I decided to read whenever I\u0026rsquo;m confused and not feel bad about feeling bad about myself. Whenever I feel like reading something, I either take my kindle or read an article from the internet. I\u0026rsquo;ve read your blog posts and letters multiple times and each time I read, I get a new insight. Thanks for writing those. I\u0026rsquo;m always intrigued by the way you write things in your blog. I hope that\u0026rsquo;s how you think. It\u0026rsquo;s really minimal and the flow of thoughts is incredibly linear. I read a book called Think Straight by Darius Foroux last year and it feels simple to do that, but not easy. I was curious to know how I think and how contaminated my thoughts are. I recently did a dopamine detox. It\u0026rsquo;s more than a digital detox. I stayed away from my laptop, phone, television, kindle, instant gratification activities, talking with people, tea/coffee, etc. for 24 hours. Things I did were meditating and documenting my thoughts. Documentation of thoughts to clear the mind and to learn how you think is called brain vomit. I read about this somewhere from the internet. I always used to reset myself once in a week by smoking up and it does just the opposite of dopamine detox. But this thing was hard. I ended up meditating thrice. I didn\u0026rsquo;t use an app or a specific technique per se. I was just accepting my thoughts by closing my eyes. So 3x1hr sessions. From the very next day, I felt fresh and relieved. I could do anything I was struggling with before. That frustration whenever I stuck while coding up a problem, the difficulties I faced while reading research papers which made me think about my lack of understanding capacity and whatnot - every distraction was just gone. I did my workout for 1hr followed by the remote work I\u0026rsquo;ve been trying to do and read my kindle in between. That day was beautiful. It went exactly as I planned but when I tried to sleep at night, I just couldn\u0026rsquo;t sleep. The next day I wasn\u0026rsquo;t insisting to do anything per se. Just did the things I felt like doing but I turned off the push notifications on my phone and used the internet when it was necessary only. I could sleep at that night very well. I felt interesting to experiment the things out of the books I read about habits. This doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be the one suitable for me. I should adapt slowly by accepting my imperfections I feel.\n  I\u0026rsquo;m closing this letter with this last paragraph. This is about things just getting right and suddenly everything goes wrong but still managing to breathe. When I visited New York for a code sprint last year, I was mind blown by the things I saw there. I wanted to visit the US again. I\u0026rsquo;d dreamed of settling there. So, I started working hard with the research and it took more than two months to get two of the FTs accepted with funding. There are long stories behind that. But that would make this letter even longer. So, I\u0026rsquo;m omitting those. I\u0026rsquo;d to setup my BTP also and I wanted to do that in CS dept. I sent mails to some profs, some didn\u0026rsquo;t reply, some replied negatively and one replied positively asking me to meet him in the office. I\u0026rsquo;d hopes on him but he humiliated me instead there. I was like I am not good enough, I should be doing most of the people are doing and couldn\u0026rsquo;t aim big. On the last date of application submission, I mailed a prof who didn\u0026rsquo;t even reply once before and was not found in his office whenever I tried to meet him. I mailed him just for the sake of it as my facad told me that he would extend the deadline if I forward him a mail to a prof asking for BTP. Unexpectedly, he agreed to mentor me. Suddenly everything felt like were going exactly as I planned. The very next day US declared emergency because of covid and I just can\u0026rsquo;t go there for my summers. They agreed to mentor me remotely though. I reached home just before the lockdown and it\u0026rsquo;s been two months now. My parents are really happy to have me around. They\u0026rsquo;re afraid of me getting away from them. It\u0026rsquo;s really hard to work from home. This covid made me afraid to settle abroad and still got me confused. This letter turned out to be really long and contain a lot of personal information. I didn\u0026rsquo;t do that on purpose.\n  Regards,\n  I responded - Hi :name-retracted:,\nThank you for writing this letter. Also, thank you for opening up and sharing the thoughts from your mind. This is a rare pleasure. Let me try to reciprocate! :)\nI first saw you on a Metakgp demo day event and I have been fascinated by you since then. Those were the early years of KOSS. I was looking for people in KGP who resonated with the idea. I would always carry a mental model of students with me who were perfect for a community like KOSS and people who would definitely enjoy being there. What you were in your first year, soon became the face of my mental model.\nWith your experience, intellect and ability to communicate, you are easily someone I wanted to be in my first year. I am glad our efforts and the people involved in the KGP Open Source community fascinated you and now we are close.\nWhat you wrote above related to intoxication made me so excited! They have been some of my favourite topics to talk about. Externally it looks like a conversation about having a drink early in college, but the bigger picture is more about waking up.\nI believe most of us in our first year are not awake in many senses. Just after the restless two years of the grand exam preparation, we are not ready to own our thoughts and actions. We eagerly seek advice, for someone to answer us \u0026ndash; What now?. We are sensitive and vulnerable to our surroundings. Some of us use the words of our parents and guardians as the governing principles of our life. Some of us blindly follow the first few seniors that we meet and spend our whole college life doing things which we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have done otherwise. This is harmful in many ways but not necessarily bad for everyone.\nTalking about life in college, I am currently reading Steve Jobs biography by Walter Isaacson. The pages about his college life are inspiring to me. I would not do everything that he used to do (Extreme diets, sleeplessness, not showering, being rude to parents/people in general), but his energy and attitude towards life defined him in those moments.\nThe young students of IITs refusing to do some things which the society has asked them not to do, is a grey area to talk about. Without forcing anything on them, I would instead share one of these questions that I asked myself very early in college.\nAm I thinking for myself?\nDo I question everything?\nHow important is it for me to solve this assignment?\nWhat difference will it make if I get a B instead of A or EX grade?\nIs this the best use of my time?\nDo I have the right people around me?\nAre my friendships healthy? Am I exploring the depths of my relationships?\nDo I love the work that I do or want to do in future?\nGood news is that a lot of us start thinking for ourselves sooner or later. But to do it as early as possible is an amazing experience and shows us the parts of life which we couldn\u0026rsquo;t have seen otherwise. To sum it up, I am not directly promoting drinking and smoking up in college. Doing it mindlessly has bad consequences for most of us. They are nothing but a medium for us to start living a free life in a higher state of consciousness. What you have written above about the realisation and acceptance makes you brave, and you should see it this way.\nThank you for your words about my blog. I am influenced by Paul Graham\u0026rsquo;s Write Like You Talk essay. I was in the literary society back in college and I would see writers complicate their pieces by trying to write in a very different, unreal way, which they thought is aesthetic. At the same time, I was fascinated by the poems and proses which were easy to comprehend but much harder to fully understand. Talking about Paul Graham, my favourite essay from him is called Life is Short. I keep getting back to this essay every couple months. It is heartfelt advice for people of our age.\nLovely to hear about your full day dopamine detox. Damn, I could never do it now. If my mother tried calling me on Whatsapp and I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t respond in an hour or two, she will start getting worried. But, I respect the idea. I am also fascinated by the 10 days Vipassana meditation course where we eat less, live in silence and do Vipassana meditation 10 hours per day, to witness thoughts and sensations come and go.\nI remember that you quit Facebook too. It is amazing how we want to spend a healthy life by being mindful about all the dopamine agents around us. I think one of the worst habits of people (including me) is that we do not respect the time between waking up in the morning and us connecting and catching up with the internet. That period of time determines how the rest of our day will go. Some people call it having a slow morning, which is doing slow, mundane things in that block of time. It includes things like making coffee, making our bed, washing dishes, showering, staring outside at the morning sun, etc. This slowness boosts our energy for the rest of the day. For me, nothing is worse than getting up from bed and scrolling Twitter for 10 minutes straight. That dials down my tempo for hours in the day. You can read more about \u0026ldquo;Slow Morning\u0026rdquo; on the internet.\nI am personally sad to see the effects of COVID-19 on the college students. I feel sad that you didn\u0026rsquo;t get to experience the internship in the US. But I\u0026rsquo;m happy to know that you got to work remotely!\nYour story with the professors back in KGP is disappointing. For me, it has been a vicious circle of me skipping classes and me not learning anything from my professors. The segregation of departments and disciplines is a legacy model and affects many students who want to study subjects outside of our assigned departments.\nLet me end by mentioning a letter from Richard Feynman called Do not remain nameless to yourself. He wrote this to one of his PhD students after winning the Nobel Prize. You might have read this already. It is inspiring for people in Science and Technology. Barriers like nasty professors or broken interview systems will not stop you and me from accomplishing what we want to do. \u0026ldquo;No problem is too small or too trivial if we can really do something about it.\u0026rdquo; Someone as skilful as you should grow thick skin for them and keep working on things that you love. I know you love solving problems and creating software. It should be all that is important.\nDefinitely enjoy the time at home with family. Let\u0026rsquo;s keep in touch.\n","date":1591315200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591315200,"objectID":"d1da620bb25a5acbc3a23b9d2d34caa8","permalink":"https://orkohunter.net/letters/letter-with-no-subject-1/","publishdate":"2020-06-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/letters/letter-with-no-subject-1/","section":"letters","summary":":name-retracted: wrote -  Hi Himanshu,\n  Congratulations from the bottom of my heart for joining Spotify.

The cherry blossoms season just started. There is a lot of nature surrounding downtown Tokyo. I haven\u0026rsquo;t experienced the peak of summer here yet, but the cold climate has been cherry on top of it all.\nI spent five years in my college campus where you could spot trees from anywhere (my hostel room, classrooms and the roads). Having all this nature around me once again was a relief.\n  Most people are mindful, quiet and private. This is great for those who want to live a private life. I believe my friends and I used to be the only ones talking in the entire freaking train.\n  Delicacies! I don\u0026rsquo;t remember having a bad meal ever. The proportion size and the amount of calories are thoughtfully decided. The meals are prioritized to be healthy and tasty. This is not true for many countries.\n  Japan is very safe. I know many of my friends never locked their apartments before going out (bad idea). Walking outside late at nights does not feel threatening. I am raised to be careful about incoming traffic and being stoic about what could go wrong. Certainly, I have never had any bad experience. I didn\u0026rsquo;t encounter any homeless people either.\n  The city is mostly clean. People do not enter anyone\u0026rsquo;s house with their shoes on. There is almost zero vandalism.\n  The customer service can not be imagined and replicated easily in other societies of the world. I know and have heard that people in India are very helpful. I felt people in Japan sometimes do beyond normal things for their customers. People take their jobs very seriously. The entire bank staff greets you when you come in. You will not be left unattended even for a minute. And everyone will say Thank you and keep bowing until you get out of the door and disappear. My God, I used to feel bad.\n  The not-so-good things that I had heard are also true!\n  Language barrier\nYou can get by in Tokyo if you don\u0026rsquo;t know Japanese and have friends whom you can talk to. But my life was of a tourist and was limited in social terms. Essential shopping (groceries, etc.) becomes limited. I have to show an image and hope that the person can recognize what I am asking for. Using a public service e.g. Hospitals, courier service is hard. I can not enquire what I want to. Google Translate is barely helpful, and is useless most of the times.\nMany people learn Japanese after coming here. They see a life here and want to settle. As of now, I know I only want to settle in India and maybe in an English speaking country. My work required no Japanese, hence I did not learn. Instead I invested my time in learning new paradigms of programming in a large company. I feel I made the right decision and learnt a lot.\n  Rush hour traffic\nYou need courage to commute in the morning. Even if I wanted to start my day early, it is not going to happen. Trains are packed at more than 200% of their capacity between 7-9 AM. I won\u0026rsquo;t need to hold any bars in the moving trains because maybe five people would be pushing me from all directions. Lo and behold the laws of physics, I won\u0026rsquo;t fall or even move when the train accelerated. xD\n  Principles of work Things I learnt in my first job\nLiving asynchronously Three years ago, I read this blog post by Quincy Larson, the founder of freecodecamp.org, titled Live asynchronously.. I got inspired by it. I took the concepts of Promises and callbacks in Javascript on a philosophical level.\nWorking Synchronously is the easy option. Async is hard to code and to practice in real life.\nLiving async means writing negligible number of messages/emails which require you to constantly wait until there is response. They block you from continuing to work on something else. Living async means lesser number of unimportant meetings and sync ups. In fact, when I used to be stuck in the beginning, I used to write my doubts as long expressive messages and would not expect a response immediately. I think I learnt this from the Open Source communities. ;)\nEdit: Some folks asked me on twitter to elaborate on this, so I wrote a follow up blog post about living asynchronously.\nWorking concurrently I always took two or more concurrent (independent) tasks at the same time. If I get blocked or maybe bored with the first task, I would switch to the second one and would wait until I get unblocked. It is not feasible when the first task is huge. But even then, it can be broken down into chunks of concurrent pieces. And then, I would \u0026ldquo;parallelly process\u0026rdquo; them on my end.\nWriting daily notes I used to take notes aggressively when I started working. I would write more than 100 words each day. I would publish them on an internal Confluence space.\nThe main reasons for doing this were -\n We forget. The meetings with our managers, mentors and coworkers in our first month are crucial. They convey some of the most important things about the company, team, project, etc. It was important for me to write all of it down. Self review. At the end of the day, I would go through my notes and publish a summary of things I did, things I learnt, etc. It would take 10 minutes each day. My quarterly self reviews used to be very very long and exhaustive, since I had the logs of what I did. After six months, I changed the frequency of publishing the logs to weekly, but I would still take daily private notes. Being public. My page was easily accessible by visiting go/himanshu from inside the company. I loved that I was being transparent about how I am spending my time in the company. And it also helped my indirect co-workers to know what I do here.  Docs, docs. code. docs. docs. Technical specs. Working on code without documentation is not fun. You are surprised each time you add a new feature. You have low confidence when making changes. For the love of humanity, document your decisions and the architecture.\nIntegration tests Unit tests are great. But I love end to end integration tests a lot. They give me more confidence that the functionality will not break with my PRs being merged. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t resist writing an integration test for the project I was working on. You might have seen some gifs about X unit tests and 0 integration tests.\nNo unconstructive criticism When we join a new place, we notice hundreds of things that can be done better (according to us). If I go on complaining about all, and do not offer to fix any, I am being unhelpful. So, I did not offer any unnecessary feedback or criticism unless they were constructive. This is the Chapter 1 of How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie.\nScoping a project, breaking down into smaller tasks A good engineer is supposed to see the bigger picture of a project. They collaborate hand in hand with Product managers and help in writing the Spec. They break the project into smaller tasks which help them correctly estimate the timeline. They offer creative solutions which the PM might not be aware of. This skill comes with experience and time spent in the company and is valued by everyone around.\nNext steps with Spotify In a few months, I will relocate to Stockholm, Sweden. Hopefully, the travel is permitted by then. My work will be related to Spotify\u0026rsquo;s newly open sourced project called Backstage. Spotify has been developing this for four years and has now decided to open source it, to simplify the infrastructure complexity in companies. Check it out, you\u0026rsquo;ll find it interesting. backstage.io\nI am personally very excited that I will get to work closely with Remy Decausemaker again. Remy was my direct manager at Twitter. He now leads the Open Source program at Spotify. I have learnt so much about Open Source in the time that I have worked with him and I feel blessed that there lies more. :)\nAs far as I know from Spotify engineering blogs and the people, it has a strong engineering culture. Teams (Squads) have autonomy of the work they do. People share knowledge and support collaboration and individual growth. I intend to stay in the company for long and hopefully I come out as a much better engineer.\nPlus, Spotify is a product that I have been using for many years. It has helped me find artists who have touched my soul. I am very excited about what lies ahead.\nCheers!\n","date":1590105600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590105600,"objectID":"ca002ed6479586afb85a864ee08c2bc8","permalink":"https://orkohunter.net/blog/spotify/","publishdate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/spotify/","section":"blog","summary":"I have written about living in Japan, my work principles and what lies ahead.","tags":null,"title":"Joining Spotify in Sweden","type":"blog"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Tech"],"content":"What is this project? 🐍 PEP8Speaks = PEP 8 + Speaks\nGitHub: https://github.com/OrkoHunter/pep8speaks\nPEP 8 is Python\u0026rsquo;s recommended coding style convention, popular across software written in Python language.\nPEP8Speaks is a GitHub app which reviews the Python code style in Pull Requests.\nHow did it start? 📜 My primary motivation to create this project was to reduce the workload of code maintainers and reviewers in Open Source. They spend a valuable amount of time doing code reviews. Checking and fixing code style is something that can be automated. Hence, it must be!\nI made the first commit in December 2016. I was in my third year of college. In my first two summer breaks, I had been contributing to Open Source projects in Python, mainly because of the Google Summer of Code program. And in a few months, I was about to be a GSoC mentor, which meant doing code reviews. PEP8Speaks came alive out of my personal need.\nUsers and adoption 📈 Creating and maintaining the project was not the hardest part. After the initial few months, I rant out of all my ideas. So, the development slowed down. Hence I wanted other projects to start using it.\nMore users meant a lot of things. I got to work on new features, optimizations, security, etc. Being very young in my career, meant this was a wonderful way to do Software development.\nPEP8Speaks is useful for an open source project which has many contributors i.e. organizations. It is not very helpful if you are the only one working on your project. Hence most of the time, if someone finds it useful, they have to convince all the maintainers in their organization to start using it.\nLarger orgs are more hesitant in adding new things as a requirement or dependency because they are worried that it would not work properly. Hence, I needed to build trust in the project.\nGrowth efforts In short, organic growth requires me to do the following -\n  Being open for feature requests.\nMany cool features in PEP8Speaks are not my original ideas, but recommendations from the community.\nDevelopers rarely want to change the way they work. Instead, they love bending (customizing) the tools they use.\nIf only PEP8Speaks were to support this new feature A,\nif only PEP8Speaks supported this feature B, \u0026hellip;we would love to adopt it!\n  Implementing feature requests.\nOne way of gaining trust in the community is to listen to the issues and incoming Pull Requests. These users helped a lot in spreading the word.\nAnd so, I need to address all the feature requests. But it is also limited by the time I have. So, I need to pick among those requests.\n  Having a helpful README\nEvery knowledge required to install and customize PEP8Speaks has to be on the README. And also, in a visually discoverable way. Having a kickass README is a must.\n  Spreading the word at the right places\nI was a speaker at the SciPy 2017 conference in Austin. In the lightning talks session, I talked about PEP8Speaks. The ballroom had close to a thousand Python developers. (SciPy conference is a yearly \u0026ldquo;pilgrimage\u0026rdquo; in the Scientific Python world.)\nAnd this is the reason, a lot of PEP8Speaks users include scientific Python projects.\n   PEP8Speaks bot has commented on around 17,000 pull requests.\n Most popular users    Logo Organization Description      Pandas Powerful data manipulation tools for Python    Adobe Open source from Adobe    openSUSE Linux distribution    PyTorch Lightning The lightweight PyTorch wrapper for ML researchers.    xarray (PyData) N-D labeled arrays and datasets in Python (Python for Data)    SunPy Python for Solar Physics    Astropy Astronomy in Python    Scikit Learn Contrib scikit-learn compatible projects    Scikit Image Image processing in Python    Spyder IDE The Scientific Python Development Environment    NetworkX Python library for graph theory and complex networks    Statsmodels Statistical modeling and econometrics in Python     GitHub API allows me to find out all the users of the project. I keep the list of all organizations and users on the public wiki.\n Sponsorship 💳 Even though the project is a free and open source software, it needs to be hosted on a server to work. The server receives around 3,000 API requests per minute. I deployed it on Heroku because it was free of cost. Heroku gave a limited number of hours per month for the servers to run. Within 1 year, the app started exhausting all the hours very quickly. And then I had to pay for the server costs.\nIn March 2019, I wrote a case to receive funding for the project. https://github.com/OrkoHunter/pep8speaks/wiki/Funding\nI wrote to the PSF for the Python Software Foundation grant. They agreed to cover one year of server costs. 🎉\nThe project also received funding from Weblate and CCExtractor, which is amazing!\nFuture of the project ⏳ The project does not have many bugs, but I do receive one or two issues in the repository per month. I have a local setup with few Jupyter Notebooks where I do the debugging and I fix the problem for them. My main concern is that debugging PEP8Speaks is not straightforward. I want to make the development process smooth. This means the project can be maintained by more people, not one person.\nPEP8Speaks can be installed on public repositories with a few clicks, but running on private repositories is not trivial. I have written the instructions to do it. There are currently 9 private forks of PEP8Speaks, that I know of. But, I want to make it easier for private repositories to start using it. Just like running CircleCI or Codecov on private repos.\nThe last most important thing in my mind is to improve the infrastructure.

I am mostly writing metaphors here.\nQuick intro to BFS and DFS In Graph Theory, we perform a search by traversing the graph. We start with one node and traverse the entire graph until we find what we are looking for.\nThere are many ways to do that, but the two most popular ones are Breadth First Search (BFS) and Depth First Search (DFS). The name of the method is key to what do they do.\nIn BFS, we search all the neighbour nodes first. And then search the 2nd-degree neighbours, then 3rd-degree, and so on. Here is a neat animation from Wikipedia for you.\nBut in DFS, we start with a neighbour and keep going in its branch as deep as we can, and then backtrack to a second neighbour and go deep into its branch, and so on.\nRead the wikipedia articles if you want to know more. BFS \u0026amp; DFS.\nWhat are you saying? BFS and DFS can be seen among people as traits of how they make friends. Like introversion and extroversion, BFS and DFS are the characteristics of people\u0026rsquo;s approach to friendship.\n You might already have some idea by now. Take few seconds and draw a picture. Imagine two people (one doing BFS and other doing DFS) and think how they are different. It is fun to observe and ponder. :)\nCollege campus life is a perfect setting to spot both kinds of people.\n How are they different? A person who is on the extreme end with BFS would generally have a larger number of friends and smaller number of acquaintances. They constantly seek to convert their acquaintances into friends. They do not have any hard time making friends with someone. They have a fear of missing out on creating new friendships as time slips by.\nA person who is on the other extreme with DFS would have a significant number of acquaintances but a smaller number of friends. They would always be interested in taking their friendships on to the next level. They are NOT afraid of missing out on new friendships and want to work a lot on the existing ones.\nBFS people can generate the same intensity in new friendships, as with their existing friends. They don\u0026rsquo;t need much time for this. Yet, most of the time BFS people are afraid to go deep into conversations with one friend. They would stop at one point. They would fall out of conversations pretty easily. They wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be interested in knowing more about their friends. They would be certain they know enough about them.\nDFS people never get bored with the friends they hangout with. They are willing to share deepest level of spiritual secrets with each other. It takes a significant amount of time for their newer friendships to reach the intensity of their existing friendships. They have strong perceptions, but loosely-held. They would cheer to look at things from other people\u0026rsquo;s perceptions.\nLet me know if you can think of more differences.\nFinal words Everyone has to do BFS first. In first year of college, you don\u0026rsquo;t have enough nodes to do DFS with. So, you spend the first (and maybe second) year doing BFS. You join clubs, you hangout with your hostel-mates, and neighbours to create threads.\nAfter this, if you are a DFS person, your DFS mode will trigger. And it never stops.\nI do not have a dichotomous view on which is the right way of living. I believe one has to find the right balance.\nThanks to Nishant Nikhil for bringing this up, one fine evening back in college.\n","date":1581206400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1581206400,"objectID":"1c8a05f0b559b042c218f6f16b45e5c2","permalink":"https://orkohunter.net/blog/bfs-vs-dfs-in-friendships/","publishdate":"2020-02-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/bfs-vs-dfs-in-friendships/","section":"blog","summary":"In real life friendships, some prefer Breadth First Search, but some fancy Depth First Search.

I have developed a habbit of writing letters to friends and family for the past few years. Today, I made some of them public at orkohunter.net/letters. Some of the letters are responses, and some have responses as well. I have included the complete correspondence in each case.\nAll of the people involved in my correspondances have granted me the permission to publish them. One of them strongly encouraged me to do so, when I came up with this idea four months ago. I have removed all the names of people and places which could easily reveal their identity. I want to keep writing and hearing from them. I made sure my actions do not affect it.\nI will keep updating the space orkohunter.net/letters based on my discretion.\nGreat! Why did you do it? 1. Accountability\nWriting letters is hard. It is a kind gesture from your side but it takes time to collect your thoughts and write them down in succinct words. I have spent from three hours to a few days on each letter. Hence, it is hard to keep writing even when I want to. The awareness that I have a public space on my website, will keep me accountable to update it and to write more.\n2. It may inspire someone to write letters\nI wish more people write letters. A letter can do wonders if you want to convey a message with impact. We choose texts to communicate daily. People forget messages sent over Facebook and Whatsapp. But people remember letters and often re-read them in future.\n3. Some of the correspondences are so good that I want to share\nSome letters along with their responses are thoughtful and fantastic read for me. I thought I should share them publicly. Read them as blog posts but in the form of a dialogue.\nWhat do you think about letters? Sometimes when I get any thought, I kill the urge to text, tweet or speak. I pick a pen and write it down. I think more on it, and when the content and the value increases, I write it as a letter and send it to someone, sometimes to multiple people.\nI listen to music while writing (Pink Floyd, post-rock, epic, ambient, chill genre). It helps my thinking. I also use music to get in the mood and amplify the relevant emotions.\nThere are three steps in which I write one letter -\n Think. This occupies most (~80%) of my time. Write bullet points or content subjects. These are the gists of the paragraphs. Write. I stick to a conversational tone. It differs when I write a blog post or any other literary article.  Almost all of my letters are in the form of emails. The ones written on paper with ink are either not with me or are too personal to share. And inspired by John Keats, I too believe the words of romantic partners should be \u0026ldquo;written on water\u0026rdquo;.\n","date":1554595200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554595200,"objectID":"fb56d22d58d0f59aa2d9b349bc911289","permalink":"https://orkohunter.net/blog/letters/","publishdate":"2019-04-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/letters/","section":"blog","summary":"I made some of my letters and their responses public on my website.","tags":null,"title":"Letters","type":"blog"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1550358000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1550358000,"objectID":"68799de54cd022577e4596a208b86ebe","permalink":"https://orkohunter.net/project/pep8speaks/","publishdate":"2019-02-17T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/pep8speaks/","section":"project","summary":"A GitHub integration to automatically review Python code style on Pull Requests.\nThe project, financially sponsored by Python Software Foundation, has a community of over \n5000 Python projects and over 20,000 user interactions.\nCurrently used by many popular projects including pandas, Spyder IDE, scikit-image, scikit-learn-contrib, astropy, statsmodels, sunpy.","tags":null,"title":"PEP 8 Speaks","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Non-Tech"],"content":"During my JEE preparations, I used to make a lot of notes.

How do you distinguish genuine love for someone from infatuation? was the question.\nAnd I want to quote what I read and later express some of my thoughts on the subject. Here is the original comment.\n This is a good question.\n  \u0026hellip; It’s really easy to confuse it with genuine love. But for me anyway, infatuation is a lot more like a drug.\n  It’s a feeling that consumes you with temporary euphoric highs, and deep, dark lows. It’s almost like a panicked state of obsession. It fills your brain so all you can think about is that person. You start to care less about what really matters in your own life\u0026hellip;your goals, your friends, your work. All that matters when you’re infatuated, is them. And you feel a strong, leeching desire to mold yourself into the person you think they’d want you to be.\n  When you’re infatuated with someone, when that person gets closer to you in any way, you feel a rush. Like you’re on cloud 9. Like you just popped a bunch of really good ecstasy. And it feels amazing in the moment. But then when you sense them distancing from you in any way\u0026hellip;an ignored text. A rescheduled date. Flirting with another person. Going out on the town without you. Whatever. It feels like the world is crumbling\u0026hellip;like you’re going through a withdrawal. You panic and fear you’re going to lose them. There’s a constant push/pull. In those moments of panic all you care about is pulling them back to you. Those up and downs can be maddening over time.\n  At its core, I think infatuation is latching onto the idealized picture your brain paints of someone. \u0026hellip; You feel in love with them even though you barely know what’s it like to really be with them. \u0026hellip; You start thinking crazy thoughts like “this person is perfect”\u0026hellip;”this person is the solution to all of my problems, if I can just keep them I’ll be fulfilled”\u0026hellip;”if I can’t have this person I’ll never be genuinely happy”. You think you’re madly in love. But it’s all shallow. Once that person actually starts getting closer to you\u0026hellip;the infatuation can wear off pretty quickly\u0026hellip;and you can be left feeling confused and deflated. Like a spent firework.\n  I think most “love at first sight”, and honeymoon periods is really just infatuation. It can turn into love, but it’s not really. And sometimes if you’re not careful, it can blind you and drag you down into some really dark places.\n  Love on the other hand, is a lot more comfortable. It’s less erratic. It grows slowly over time and stays pretty constant. Its the general feeling of caring and warmth towards someone. You can hate someone in a current moment, but still love them overall. You can find someone to be unattractive, or incompatible\u0026hellip;and still love them deep down. You can have a fight with the person you love, and not fear you’re going to lose them\u0026hellip;you just want to revolve it.\n  It’s not like a drug\u0026hellip;it doesn’t have the highs and lows of infatuation. Its gotta be cultivated and nurtured. You don’t lose yourself in it, or have the drive to turn into the person they want you to be\u0026hellip;love helps you find yourself, and drives you to become the person you want to be. Love for a partner isn’t too different than the love you feel for a blood relative. It can be subtle and mellow\u0026hellip;sometimes barely recognizable\u0026hellip;but it’s always there. You’re connected to them at a deep primal level.\n  This left me thinking for some time. Some of my thoughts:\nWe have little control over our Infatuation, but Love is a practice. It is comforting to know that love is not a fixed biological property which is set since birth. It is so much about our choices. We can learn to love and become one with it. We can teach people to practice love. Infact, there exists a very profoud meditation technique called \u0026ldquo;Loving-Kindness\u0026rdquo;.\nPeople can sometimes fall in love with their infatuation but never the person. This is so interesting to think about! This can give someone a feeling of being in love. But as the infatuation fades, the love fades as well.\nInfatuation is not bad at all. It\u0026rsquo;s as if, infatuation is our survival mechanism. But love goes beyond just surviving. It is spiritual.\nLove is not an emotion. Happiness and Sadness come in phases. They are emotions. But love is always present, in us. Our mind may get distracted sometimes. (This is whole another perception, which I felt in one experience.)\nLove is very fundamental and not complicated. Day passes by and my definition of love keeps getting shorter. Something so easy to experience, so difficult to express.\n","date":1547078400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1547078400,"objectID":"20b730a13f70b06b1da9ab62e0da5b41","permalink":"https://orkohunter.net/blog/love-and-infatuation/","publishdate":"2019-01-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/love-and-infatuation/","section":"blog","summary":"After a long time, I read something so meaningful on reddit.

It’s called Man’s Search for Meaning, written by Viktor Frankl. He was a German psychiatrist captured by Hitler’s army in one of the most horrific concentration camps. If you are not aware of “The Holocaust,” more than a million people were killed in those concentration camps and more than ten million Jews during World War II. In the Auschwitz concentration camp, he (the author) witnessed so many deaths and brutality during the time he was captured in prison. People were separated from their families and children. They were gassed up and killed if they were unfit for work. Surviving on very little food and medicines, all their lives were a misery. The author saw his companions losing hope for survival. Based on his own experience and the stories of his patients, Frankl argues that we cannot avoid suffering, but we can choose how to cope with it, find meaning in it, and move forward with renewed purpose.\nTo save you time from reading it, I will share the things I learned from this book.\nI see this book as an answer to “Why should we not be depressed?” and a guide to handling other existential questions. One of the most asked questions by the entire humanity is “What is the meaning of my life? What is the purpose of my existence?”. These questions have been here since tens of thousand years. People have created religions to answer these questions. Righteousness (Dharma) and other ethics come out of these religions. Here is what the author says -\n There is no abstract universal meaning to life. We should stop finding it. We do not need to ask this question. But life itself is asking this question from us. We have to answer it ourselves. This question is not ours to ask, but for us to answer. We create our meaning. Whether it is work, love, or courage. We create our “Why” individually. And this “Why” guides us to survive any “How”.\n He adds that —  Life is not primarily a quest for pleasure or a quest for power, but a quest for meaning. The greatest task for any person is to find meaning in his or her life. It can be anything or anyone. Suffering in and of itself is meaningless; we give our suffering meaning by the way in which we respond to it.\n Finally, something which I’ll always try to remember is —  Forces beyond your control can take away everything you possess except one thing, your freedom to choose how you will respond to the situation. You cannot control what happens to you in life, but you can always control what you will feel and do about what happens to you.\n This book is nothing but a relief, a motivation to lead a peaceful and meaningful life.\nWhen I thought upon how we are raised, I noticed that our parents, teachers, and well-wishers try to inflict us with what gave meaning to their lives. My grandfather found purpose in a well-paid job because he had a sizeable low-income family to feed. That was it. He is 88 years old now, and the meaning of life still hasn’t changed for him. My father finds the purpose of life in a loving family. Everyone should talk to each other and support each other in their difficult times. I don’t know why he does that, but that is what I am aware.\nNeither of those two are correct nor incorrect. As an individual, I respect what drives them. But every time my grandfather says “I wish you get crores rupees of salary and stand 1st in your college”, I smile and silently disagree.\nSo :name-retracted:, the next time you think of something which you have not achieved, which makes you feel you have not been successful, which threatens your self-esteem, take a minute and ask yourself “Is this or will this be meaningful to me?”. Meaningful doesn’t mean enjoyable but fulfilling.\nTake care, Himanshu\n","date":1541203200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1541203200,"objectID":"383cf642df25411b165e65e97b1c67d6","permalink":"https://orkohunter.net/letters/mans-search-for-meaning/","publishdate":"2018-11-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/letters/mans-search-for-meaning/","section":"letters","summary":"Dear :name-retracted:,\nI finished reading a book today.

It is hard for most people to do so. No matter how much we understand the importance of interacting with new people, mostly in the early years of our lives, it is not an easy thing to do. In my freshmen year, I never knocked the doors of my neighbors or any of my wingmates to learn about them. It was a conscious decision. But I now realize, there wasn’t a random to-be-friend knock on my door either.\nSo many years and friendships later, I can now understand that between me and any of my friends, there is always one common “thread.” It can be the Literary Society (TLS), or the Open Source folks, or the ones from KOTA, or my wing-mates, post-rock music, department, being intoxicated together, etc.\nFor two unacquainted people to start a conversation, it is a bit difficult to talk directly about each other. It won’t even go well. But it becomes relatively simple if they talk about anything that they have in common. And then they always remember that thread connecting them for the next few meetups until they don’t need the reason.\nIt’s amazing how many threads KGP creates in our lives, to give us friendships for lifetime.\n","date":1539475200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1539475200,"objectID":"4d399fe225d099dc95d65e5e74e611f7","permalink":"https://orkohunter.net/blog/threads/","publishdate":"2018-10-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/threads/","section":"blog","summary":"“You’re an interesting species.

It was a fascinating movie on emotions and AI. It was one of its kind and made me think a bit. Humans created a consciousness in the movie, and at one point it started wondering about itself.\nMaybe a lot of humans, at some point in their lives, think about the purpose of their lives (Hilariously reminds me of \u0026ldquo;You pass butter\u0026rdquo;). I found myself in the situation for the first time right after JEE, but later I forgot as programming happened to me. And then, again after reading Sapiens this December. And now, it\u0026rsquo;s stuck in my head. It\u0026rsquo;s not always a negative thought, a lot of times I happen to be smiling and puzzled as well.\nI\u0026rsquo;m glad psychedelics exist in the world. It made me constantly aware of the mysterious and unknown, made me witness colors never seen before, geometries beyond apprehension, and gifted a broad palette of emotions.\nOften at times, I self-construct arguments against psychedelics being good and then later work on the counter-arguments. I have an interesting thought to share.\nThink of our ancient tradition. Children during their brahmacharya were recommended to have a Guru. It was a norm to grow up having a guru. In the case of Eklayva, his teacher was a statue, not a living person. So, Guru was a concept but mostly found in the form of life. I highly recommend a thoughtful psychedelic experience to my friends once in life. I ask them to respect what they think of intaking. I believe these chemicals and plants have the potential to be the guru in this modern age. That is the thought. Also, not all teachers and teachings are good (thus, Bad Trips), but there is always a lesson to learn, always a lesson to think about.\n :name-retracted: responded   and gifted a broad palette of emotions.\n   I believe the emotions I have collected from the small out-of-world experience I had is the best thing I kept with myself after the trip. Now I listen to the same music with more intense emotions. Now I live the same life with more vividness. (And the most wonderful thing about reading your mail is: I hadn\u0026rsquo;t given many thoughts how these emotions emerged, I will now. Surely, these trips have changed my composition as human. (Romantic ahaa!))\n  We all have our unique mental models about the world and there are a lot of mental models trying to dictate our ways through life. (Most people aren\u0026rsquo;t even aware of them. - I wasn\u0026rsquo;t aware until I went for that Himachal trip).\n  Example: the usage of \u0026lsquo;we\u0026rsquo; everywhere is a small mental model about the world, watching a series of actions like a sequential programmer is another mental model, trying to optimize petty things, and watching people as a neural network model is another. We had these experiences and we have these models in our mind.\n  These are the consequences of being from :state-name-retracted:, being a c++/python programmer, competitive programmers, deep learning engineer in the order the examples are given.\n  And when I took pyshedelics, I created another mental model. It is about open-mindedness. It is compassionate and weak as a twig, at the same time it is strong as the storms. It embraces other mental models and tries to break them from bias.\n  Maybe if I hadn\u0026rsquo;t taken it, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have come out from the clutches of commitment. Staying in commitment for the sake of it is biased. (Commitment in itself is not).\n  When you are about to break a commitment, there is a lot of \u0026lsquo;socio-cultural\u0026rsquo; norms to stop you. More than anything, it is your mind asking you not to do it for the sake of \u0026lsquo;moral\u0026rsquo; compass you have set. Then you realize \u0026lsquo;love\u0026rsquo; is greater than any norms/compass and that love shouldn\u0026rsquo;t make you feel mediocre. I realized I feel more loved(more dopamine) when I see the white moon by the trees than her (This was the snap moment, our last LSD trip). I had written a small sentence during those time:\n  \u0026ldquo;Kahu kaise tujhe ki ek samandar se sukoon mila par dhoop nikalne pe wapas jana hai\u0026rdquo; (Hindi)\n  And it doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that you hate the ocean, that you have suddenly started hating it. It\u0026rsquo;s just that if \u0026lsquo;love\u0026rsquo; is there, you\u0026rsquo;ll carry the essence of the oceans within you, wherever you go. Everyone carries something, and you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t carry the things just for the sake of carrying(commitment just for the sake of commitment) but only if you want to (love).\n  I am always a tiny bit confused in this matter. There is yet some fingerprints on the glass, next psychedelic would help me get it cleaner.\n  So here is how I used some open-mindedness I gathered from my trips. It shackled some norms set in my mind.\n   I highly recommend a thoughtful psychedelic experience to my friends once in life.\n   Just to clarify, I would like to add a single point. It\u0026rsquo;s for everyone but not \u0026lsquo;every\u0026rsquo;time. I can provide almost anyone with an LSD but not DMT. Even :name-retracted:, I have never given him DMT. It\u0026rsquo;s just that you have to feel (judge) whether they would embrace what they see. These are tough things we are looking at, it can make people but break them too.\n  I really believe you already know this but added for the sake of availability bias.\n ","date":1533340800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1533340800,"objectID":"83c84c0370733267273fa9c92391d21c","permalink":"https://orkohunter.net/letters/on-psychedelics/","publishdate":"2018-08-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/letters/on-psychedelics/","section":"letters","summary":"I wrote - Hello :name-retracted:!\nLast night, I watched the movie Her.

I feel like talking to you about life. (Which I always want to do. All the time. It’s almost like I met you yesterday and quickly got comfortable in saying things.)\nSo. There we go. There is a married couple somewhere on the outskirts of a town, renting a one bedroom apartment in a 10-story dull looking building. They have a median family income. (Imagine the couple in movie The Lunchbox). The family wakes up and goes to work. The wife prepares and sends him the lunchbox. And she always does thousands of other household chores, which look trivial but are as difficult as any job. The days are tiring. The couple gets together for dinner later in the evening. Let’s say they watch a movie, or a reality dance show with a celebrity guest, or maybe a scheduled TV serial, as usual. And this goes on for a long time. Like, really long time.\nThey constantly feel that something is missing. Suddenly, their lives look like an incomplete picture in front of them. They realize maybe they don’t have it all. So they decide to do what billions of us have decided in the past, i.e. to raise a kid. The kid gives them love to share in exchange for some financial load and a whole lot of time from both their lives. But they get happier, or maybe. Their lives go on, a bit busier than before. They are 3 people now. Everything is new to the child, so he/she is excited as hell. But the mundane stuff starts happening again. The dinner, the TV, the feeling of “something missing” from their lives.\nSo many of these families never figure out what was missing. I have seen a few. There are millions of them in our country.\nAll this time, these people look at something only to realize, they don’t have it. They look at people in the movies/serials wearing clothes which they don’t have. The house, they don’t have. The parties they don’t go to. Or the romance, as shown in the movies. All of the mainstream media shows them things that they want, but do not have. But the worst part is, that the media tells them that those things exist and there is still hope, most of which is imaginary. So, they live in the expectation of achieving something which does not exist in reality or is too tedious to get.\nI have known this for a long time. But only now I realize, it’s very natural for us to do that. This has been going on for thousands of years. It’s called the human’s struggle for finding the meaning of life.\nWe think we live with a purpose. And that we were sent with a purpose. We invented religion to make us believe that there is a white-bearded man above the clouds, always looking at us and that he loves all of us.\nSo, when a self-awakened man comes and says, “You know what, we don’t exist with any purpose at all”. Or when Carl Sagan tells us about how vast our entire universe is and that we are nothing but pale blue dots in the whole picture; we feel so small. And that’s it. At this point, the one who realizes and accepts that we are not special, is known as a Buddha, and rest of us constantly miss out on life desiring to be special.\nWhat is wrong with not being special?\nNot a thing.\nThe reason why I am saying all this to you is that I don’t worry about our love not being what it isn’t. I am a simple guy, who thinks about the girl he loves when he wakes up and looks at her picture before going to bed in the night.\nAnd I think as much as I accept this love as it is, the more joyful I can be.\n Bas itna hi kehna tha, kuch jyada shabdon mein :)\n Himanshu\n","date":1531785600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1531785600,"objectID":"c13300f5e66563c48775783b7f62ded9","permalink":"https://orkohunter.net/letters/it-is-okay-not-to-be-special/","publishdate":"2018-07-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/letters/it-is-okay-not-to-be-special/","section":"letters","summary":"Hi :name-retracted:!\nI hope I don’t bore you with this letter.

TELL ME HOW TO DO IT ON DC++!!\n Lol, come to Linux already!\n Note: I shall not be giving out a one-click solution to monitor DC searches intentionally even if it were possible. But if you are dedicated enough, you can figure things out by reading it. Also, I’m not the first person to know about this.\n What is DC? It’s a peer-to-peer file sharing protocol. Computers connected with each other can share files among them, and if you are on LAN, you get them on a terrific speed.\n  GET TO THE POINT!!\n Alright, alright.\nTheory Let’s say Mr X and I are connected to a DC hub. Let’s say it happens that both of us are online at the same time. Mr X searched for New movies in their favorite DC client e.g. DC++, LinuxDC++, etc. Their client sends this request to the hub we both are connected, to fetch a search result. The hub then forwards the request to everyone who is connected to it and returns the index for Mr X to click and download any file from anyone.\n SO GIVE ME THE SCRIPT. OR DO YOU HAVE THE CODE OR A REPOSITORY?\n There isn’t really a script or any code. :/\nExploit Because of the theory, we can sit back, stay connected to the hub and receive a holy large amount of data like\n Who joined/left the hub when, their nick and their IP address What are people searching for and IP address associated with each query  If you are in KGP, you can trace back the IP addresses to even room numbers.\nTechnology Normal DC clients won’t allow us to see these requests. There is a client known as ncdc (distributed as a binary) which doesn’t really have a GUI, so you can run it on a terminal (Aah, the feels it gives!)\n Use ncdc to connect to the hub Enable logging to a file and set log_debug to True Note: This will generate a lot of data if you’re connected to a large hub and thus make sure you keep clearing the log file Use tail -f /path/to/logfile to see the queries sent by DC Parse the queries and tada! Protip: You can feed Kibana the data and visualize them.  You probably will have to set some config in ncdc to change from Passive mode to Active mode or else, some hubs mights ban you. Google properly, read the ncdc documentation and you’ll be fine.\nEDIT: Siddharth Kannan used tcpdump to capture the TCP/IP packets which contains the DC query strings as well. Check out the 107,000 search results he accumulated in a week over here stored as all_packet_info.json. This is the code he used\nsudo tcpdump -b -t src 10.109.xx.xx -w incoming-search-`date +%s`.pcap -c 1000; Live Streaming It’s hard. But if you really want to live stream the searches and that to be accessible outside of the campus network, there is a hack. You can have a server hosted somewhere outside the network which is going to stream data to the public. Share the URL of this server to people you want to. Create an endpoint over here which can receive data through POST request. Now, use your laptop from inside the network to constantly send requests on to the server. Make sure to use authentication by headers to avoid exploitation!\nThere’s some leftover code if you can find use of them.\nNow you have this, here’s something you need to remember: Don’t be dick. That’s all.\nHappy Hacking! ✨\n","date":1524009600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1524009600,"objectID":"90d9bc41ddab9a79476e0c525752e1a4","permalink":"https://orkohunter.net/blog/peeking-over-dc-search/","publishdate":"2018-04-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/peeking-over-dc-search/","section":"blog","summary":"IS THIS EVEN POSSIBLE?\n Well, Yeah.\n BUT YOU PROBABLY NEED TO BE A DC ADMIN TO GET THIS, NO?\n Nope.

As the title suggests, I have had many musings upon the similarity and the differences of these three entities which can be thought as a subset of ‘I’ and which have very diffused boundaries among their definitions.\nDisclaimer: The following ideas are highly subjective. I would not advise the reader to consider them factual. Also, instead of focusing too much on the scientific details, the reader should try to read the hints to what I’m trying to communicate by using language.\nLet’s Define  Cogito ergo sum (I think therefore I am) — René Descartes\n The entity ‘I’ or ‘Me’ is a strange topic of discussion. While some people would oversimplify this to the human body, others might overcomplicate and make this is a subject of spiritual mysticism. I want to remain sane on this topic and probably write the words which can make sense in daily life.\nFor me, the majority of ‘I’ is divided into three parts or layers, namely the Brain, the Mind and the Consciousness. The Brain is the outermost layer, the frontier of the Self. Take a scenario for example. You are reading this text. The first ‘You’ is your eyes, receiving colorful light rays from the screen. The ‘You’ then converts this information into electrical signals for further processing. This part is called Brain. It is an entirely physical entity, made of matter which interacts with the outer world through our senses, i.e., sight, touch, smell, taste, and sound.\nThe Brain is very close to a computer program, and vice versa. It is programmed to execute in a definite manner. When given a set of inputs, it runs the required number and type of processes and is done with it. It encounters bugs in its lifetime which causes the dysfunctioning of some module. It also has a computing power and needs resources such as oxygen and food.\nThe Brain then tries to pass this information to our Consciousness but in comes the Mind. The Mind is that child of ours, whom we love so much that we probably can never stop listening to. The Mind constitutes of our thoughts, our emotions associated with those thoughts, reactions and Ego. If you have disliked this essay so far, your brain has nothing to do with it; it just is feeding the information to your Mind, which is sitting only to judge the content. The Mind will then react and ask your Brain (followed by the senses) to either continue or stop reading.\nWe can look at the Mind as a semi-physical entity. On one side it shares boundaries with the physical bodies like sensations and hormones, while on the other hand, it has slight access to the metaphysical entities inside us which are hard to define as matter, i.e., Consciousness and Ego.\nThe Consciousness is the purest form of ‘I,’ which does not think, which does not react, which does not speak with our mouth, which does not listen with our ears, which does not recognize anything as good or bad, pleasant or unpleasant. It is a thoughtless entity. It can interchangeably be understood as ‘the energy of life’. If you have ever been a psychonaut, this is the ‘vibration’ part of self, and it does communicate to other consciousness. If your consciousness is unaware of something which only your brain and mind knows (Take the statement ‘We should love everyone’ for example), it is entirely possible that you might react unexpectedly in extreme situations, contradictory to what you think you should never have done.\nThe Chariot Do you remember the scene from the epic Mahabharat? During the battle scene, the chariot with the most attention was of Arjun. Now there’s a great symbolism to be drawn from the setting. There is Arjun with all the weapons, perplexed with the myriad of thoughts about the battle, sitting on a chariot with Krishna, who is calm and patiently replying to all of the questions thrown by Arjun. Krishna is also the charioteer, holding the reins. There are horses driving the chariot, and finally, there’s the battleground, the vast ground where the chariot can roam around and interact with other chariots and other entities.\nCollectively if we are to compare this one picture with ‘I,’ the chariot is similar to a Body. Arjun is like the Mind having all of its thoughts, ego, and confusions. Krishna is the inner Consciousness. The reins connect the Mind with the horses, which are to be interpreted as the senses we use to interact with the external world, which here is the entire battleground of Kurukshetra. The ‘I’ functions when everything is at their place, resonating in perfect coordination.\nAfter all the questionnaire (popularly known as Bhagavad Gita), Krishna drives the chariot and is only capable of waking Arjun up and channeling all of his powers. I don’t know how reliable this symbolism should be held but loosely it’s very similar to the game of Mind and Consciousness.\nChange How are these entities altered?\nChanging the Brain is straightforward. One can close their eyes, put on earphones with music and there, the state of their Brain is now different. But closing the eyes does not mean the person shall stop thinking about it. The change in Brain has little to no effects on the Mind.\nChanging the Mind is a tedious process. It requires expertise to govern thoughts from coming in and going out. It is a long process to gain control over one’s Ego. These methods can be classified under various Meditative techniques.\nChanging the Consciousness makes you a Psychonaut. A Psychonaut is a person who experiences intentionally induced altered states of consciousness and claims to use the experience to investigate his or her Mind, and possibly address spiritual questions, through direct experience. A change in Consciousness will, by default, reflect on the Mind and the Brain as well.\nWhen people talk about Enlightenment, they mean altered Consciousness and not a new Mind. All the humans feel love, sadness, hate, anger, etc., every single one of us and is, in fact, one of the traits which define us. A monk in the Himalayas is undoubtedly not deprived of Mind, but they probably know how to open up with the Consciousness directly and not let Mind be a middle-man.\n Enlightenment doesn’t care how we reach there. — Thaddeus Golas\n The consciousness can be altered with prolonged meditation (very subjective to the technique and the person). The use of naturally occurring mushrooms containing psilocybin, DMT, LSD and many other psychedelic and psychoactive substances can also challenge Consciousness to its very core.\nCommunication I’m not sure if there is any test to know whether some information which was thrown at us, has reached our consciousness or not. Merely hearing it ensures Brain level perception. Pondering over it as a thought provides that it is floating in our Mind. But how can we know if our Consciousness is aware of it?\nThere is one practice which can make sure the thought isn’t stuck in the Mind. The method is to “Avoid Overthinking.” Overthinking is terrible. It is a risky business. On the one hand, it opens up new insights to a thought, on the other side it leads to the loss of reality and makes it very hard for any information to escape from our Minds. Another good practice is to not letting our Ego come into the picture. We can do it by not allowing our subjective feelings and judgment interfere while we catch a piece of information.\nKnowing that ‘I’ can be dissolved into these three entities can have very positive effects while communicating with others. If we can see that our words will be reflected by their layer of Ego, there is no way we can deliver our message to them despite speaking for any length of time, since it will never reach their Consciousness. We can then find out the correct choice of words to avoid their shiny surface of Mind which is eager to reflect anything that is thrown towards it such that it pierces through and reaches their Consciousness.\nMany times, we have the tendency to solve a problem with another person, just by speaking to them. Example can be a conflict of interest with our parents, friends or a significant other. But it’s wise to understand that the situation might have left the Mind of the other person very confused, and it’s best not to talk since our words will quickly bounce off them. It’s better to sit back, wait, till they work out with their Mind and are ready to communicate. Interesting to note that this is counter-intuitive to our Minds which quickly reacts by blabbering out whatever we can.\nI am not my Thoughts Why is “watching the breath” one of the first and simplest meditation techniques? During Vipassana, it is suggested to start first by the practice of watching the whole breathing cycle and rather focus on the nostrils. This is not Vipassana, but it acts as an anchor to calm the Mind so that we would be able to do the actual practice. We can give an analogy of the mind to that of a chattering monkey. The Mind usually does not shut up and keeps feeding us with thoughts, ego, and their effects. We then tell the Mind, “O hey! Do you see this? Do you see me inhaling and exhaling? It’s beautiful, isn’t it? Watch!”. It’s like giving a crying baby, a toy to play with and making her come at ease.\nOnce we start watching our thoughts, we begin to accept, and later appreciate the meaninglessness of them. Merely by watching them come and go, we build up a tolerance for a reaction, and it stops us from engaging from them in the future. We learn how futile are our thoughts, opinions, and judgments. Often at times, people are afraid of meaninglessness, which makes them value their thoughts very much. This makes them misinterpret that they are their thoughts, and thus, they build up a thick layer over their Consciousness, which is another meaningless and thoughtless entity. There is a possibility that life gets more beautiful if we stop yearning for everything to be meaningful.\nEgo Ego is a word which has been overstated and misunderstood a lot of times. Never is one’s true ego positive or negative, it’s the thoughts associated with it. A negative thought pattern can be removed while keeping the Ego intact. We just can’t let it happen very easily, since it’s so powerful. Ego is the ID of the Mind; it’s what makes us respond to someone calling our name. It might sound blissful to live after ‘Ego Death’, but that’s not how anyone can survive. Killing one’s ego is killing Self.\nIf ego death isn’t desirable, then what is? Here is a comment from /r/Psychonaut which I find very relevant.\n Personally, I don’t believe complete Ego death is possible, or even desirable. What I suggest is mastery of the Ego. Think of it like a wild animal to be tamed instead of destroyed. It is a part of you, an integral and important one, in fact, but for most people, it’s grown monstrous and completely out of control. Or put differently, it is in full control. And so we become passengers in these meat machines, with the Ego at the wheel. Dangerous stuff! The Ego is only the Ego so long as it remains distinct and separate from the rest of you. The process we should undergo is what Carl Jung called individuation: the uniting of a fractured mind, of a psyche, compartmentalized and segregated into individual parts; the merging of conscious and unconscious, Self and Ego, reasoning mind and intuitive mind. The result is that we become indivisible, whole, balanced, and more importantly, in control. How does this benefit you? Well, imagine two pilots wrestling for control of the ship. Good luck getting to your destination! Or better yet, good luck agreeing on a target. Before individuation, we’re torn and divided, conflicted and confused. We’re being driven, not doing the driving, you see? The Ego wants one thing, the Self another, and then it’s a battle for control. Or else the Ego is whispering sweet lies, and the Self is buying them wholesale so that the Self comes to believe that it and the Ego are one. This is a nice little tactic by the Ego, and one that can be observed in people on a daily basis. Defensiveness is an obvious indication of Ego identification. What are you defending? An opinion? A belief? A role? These things are not you, only things you do or things you cling to, but the Ego grows strong from false identification and so pokes and prods you into getting your back up whenever these are called into question. How do you merge with the shadow? The first step is identifying it in yourself by distinguishing between the essential you — the Self, or pure consciousness — and the stuff that isn’t you. By watching your thoughts, words, and actions, seeking out incoherence and contradictions, defensiveness and sore spots, and then calling these into question. Be harsh with yourself. And whatever you do, don’t shy away from the ugly bits: that’s where the Ego likes to hide out.### Ignorance\n Don’t we hate it when we write or speak all the facts and support our argument while the person on the other side just chooses to ignore those and raises some of their own? It is happening every second on Facebook and Twitter comments section, and it’s eating out a lot of Brains. But why do people choose to be ignorant?\nThe moment we add our entire Mind in the equation of thought process, it by default, includes the sensations in our body, emotional reactions, opinions, and separately, the Brainly activities, i.e., Reading/Listening and Writing/Speaking. Now, the Brain has no trouble in receiving any argument, neither the Consciousness has; but it’s the Mind, and if the words are causing any unpleasant sensations, we tend to reject it. And that’s where we lose.\nNo sensation is either good or bad. However, it will arise. It’s natural for all of us. The key is not in ceasing it, but accepting it, accepting that impermanence is a real thing. The sensations have come, only to pass away. It has no real meaning, and we should not be trying to give it any value. We indulge in reactions too often and thus end up losing the direct communication with our Consciousness.\nConsciousness To me, we only know the tip of the iceberg known as Consciousness. I am very impressed by Yuval Noah Harari’s understanding of the consciousness and the scientific aspects of it, written in his book Homo Deus. To me, understanding one’s consciousness is a very complicated subject since it’s very easy to overthink it. It is the subjective ability to experience. Anything can be an experience, merely sitting somewhere alone in lush green, or talking to a person, or watching the leaves fall from a tree, anything and everything can become an experience and our consciousness is responsible for the subjective aspects of it.\nI’m not capable of writing about it. I’m not capable of using terms like ‘Vibration’ and ‘Energy’ to describe it. But I secretly wish, for a scientific explanation in centuries when we’d be pondering over the consciousness of Artificial Intelligence. Even if I can see things as it is (it’s the literal meaning of Vipassana), I wish things to be proven for a systematic understanding by the humanity. Wait, what is String Theory again?\n","date":1523836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1523836800,"objectID":"1a2b0ca89899e7ac00ac13bad2f413b4","permalink":"https://orkohunter.net/blog/brain-mind-and-consciousness/","publishdate":"2018-04-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/brain-mind-and-consciousness/","section":"blog","summary":"Layers of ‘I’ when perceiving anything which is external to it\n Thanks to Montaigne, one of the first essay writers, for popularizing this literary genre.

If we pick two homo sapiens on earth, we can classify their relationship as one of these three types:\n An Acquaintance (Both of them are acquainted with each other) Unfamiliarity (No one knows about the existence of other) Celebrity status (One of the two is famous)  Today is the dawn of the 21st century. And every day in my college I meet few people who fall in none of the three types.\n Every day I see people on 2.2, whom I know by face and name, as well as they know me and my name. But we don’t stop to say, ‘Hi’\n These are my pseudo-acquaintances whom I got to know from Facebook.\nHere is the deal. Somewhere in the data centers of Facebook Inc, there is a matrix which stores the connection between two nodes, and the edge value of those people and me is True. There have been numerous CSS divs containing strings which either they or I have written, which got a click from the other, sometimes a further div of “comment” as well. Somehow, subconsciously my brain understood that a person and I had interacted a whole bunch and thus we are friends. But when the same mind physically spots them in public, that same person for the first time in months, there is no surge of emotions to go and talk to them.\nI know someone on Facebook, I “interact” with them, but I don’t speak with the same passion or eagerness to them in real life, using flesh and bones. For me, it is terrifying. What if people eventually stop using their mouth for conversations because Whatsapp and Messenger let them use that gif meme to convey more efficiently. What if we discover some other app or platform to express ourselves in the best way which is different than meeting the person and using our mouth, eyes, face, hands or smile to express?\nAnd the fact that the first world countries already have incorporated a bit of this culture, raises merely questions about parenting. What if we are not concerned about our children, and the first friend they make, do not physically exist around them. I am surely, not saying one is better than others; there are so many pros of the Scientific Revolution, Internet being a tiny monster of it. I am just saying that, are people responsible? Is Facebook responsible enough to know that it has created an illusion of friendships and relationship and does it care about it? From the weekly product and feature launches, for the sole purpose of us interacting more on their platform, and increasing their value as advertisers and not looking up from our phones, I think it does not care at all. Or is it in control of anyone to care about it? Something like a trained Deep Learning model, over which we only have very few control after some time.\n It has been quite long since I joined Facebook.com and I have spent a lot of time with the product. I have met and stayed connected with a lot of people using this platform, and therefore, I am probably thankful for it. However, here is my current setup, as of now:\n I don’t use the product ‘news feed’. I use a version of News Feed Eradicator. I ran a custom Javascript script to unfollow all of my Facebook friends and then turned on the notifications for few, as I deemed necessary in my real life. On the phone, I do not have the Facebook app and I use messenger with the setting where I do not receive any notification (interrupts) but I would instead open the app to see if there any new messages.  The last thing that I want to say is that there are mostly no good and no wrong sides. As a human, we always have to use our discretion and find something in between. Hence I can not blindly delete Facebook to solve this problem, I’ll have to see the way to use it for my productivity, as long as it doesn’t consume a lot of my time to do that.\n ","date":1519948800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1519948800,"objectID":"cfdb61e9916bc6def9981c6762314720","permalink":"https://orkohunter.net/blog/pseudo-acquaintance/","publishdate":"2018-03-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/pseudo-acquaintance/","section":"blog","summary":"It’s the dawn of the 20th century.

I was with :name-retracted: in CCD after you left. We were there for quite some time. Meanwhile, a group of people came in, including a friend from TLS. I went ahead and had a brief conversation with him. But when I noticed, there was one girl in the group whom I also knew! You know her; she is the one from the early times of :group-name-retracted: (I think you met her on :place-name-retracted:). There was a brief moment of eye contact, but it instigated no emotion. I could not even say \u0026ldquo;Hi\u0026rdquo; because of the bland reaction on our faces.\nWhen we were leaving, we noticed that she was coming out of CCD too. From there to Veggies, :name-retracted: and I walked alongside her. I am not able to forget those 40 seconds; there was too much silence to remember.\nNow here is the deal. Somewhere in the datacenters of Facebook Inc, there is a matrix which stores the connection between two nodes, and the edge value of her and me is True. There have been numerous CSS divs containing strings or bytecodes which either she or I have written, which got a click from the other, sometimes a further div of \u0026ldquo;comment\u0026rdquo; as well. Somehow, subconsciously my brain understood that this person and I had interacted a whole bunch and thus we are friends. But when the same mind physically spotted that same person for the first time in months, it was speechless.\nFor centuries, there have roughly and popularly been two types of edges between homo sapiens, either they are acquainted with each other, or they are not. For the past decade, a third type has emerged. You know someone on Facebook, you \u0026ldquo;talk\u0026rdquo; to them, but you don\u0026rsquo;t talk with that passion or eagerness to them in real life with using flesh and bones (Remember :name-retracted:?). For me, it is terrifying. What if people eventually stop using their mouth for conversations because Whatsapp and Messenger lets them use that gif meme to convey. What if we discover some other app or platform to express ourselves in the best way which is different than meeting the person and using our mouth, eyes, face, hands or smile to express?\nAnd the fact that the first world countries already have incorporated a bit of this culture, simply raises questions on parenting. What if we are not concerned about our children, and the first friend they make do not physically exist around them. I am definitely not saying one is better than others, there are so many pros of the Scientific Revolution, Internet being a tiny monster of it. I am just saying that, are people responsible? Is Facebook responsible enough to know that it has created an illusion over friendships and relationship and does it care about it? From the weekly product and feature launches, for the sole purpose of us interacting more on their platform, and increasing their value as advertisers and not looking up from our phones, I think it does not care at all. Or is it in control of anyone to care about it? Something like a trained Deep Learning model, over which we only have very few control.\nFrom a curious homosapien, who used the internet to blab to you about internet. But yes, I know we have to have this conversation when we meet and this exchange of email shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be the end, and that makes me feel better.\n :name-retracted: responded  Hi! This predicament, as you are feeling, is understandable. The oddity of changing societal rules and relationships, brought about by social-media corporations, is at times overwhelming. But if you try to understand this phenomenon at an abstract level, then perhaps we can get a bigger picture.\n  What you have thought to be a \u0026ldquo;fake\u0026rdquo; acquaintance is not fake per se, but just another expression of the changes that are taking place in our society due to social media. It is at best, friendship in the normal sense of the word or at worst, a \u0026ldquo;virtual\u0026rdquo; acquaintance.\n  Humanity has come so far only because of the large-scale cooperations between diverse groups of people.This cooperation could be achieved, thanks to fictional stories like religions, society, and other collectivities which made it easier for people to trust each other. But as we all know, socio-political evolutions necessitated new stories to bind people together, and in the process, we developed theories like democracy, communism, nation-states to fit the narrative of the time better. So the critical thing to note here is that as the narrative has changed so have the rules governing the society.\n  It is in this context that I want to place your qualms about the internet. The internet is undoubtedly forcing us to adopt a new narrative of our time and respecting the course of history over several millennia; we must be ready to accept this reality and better adapt to the changing times by altering the \u0026ldquo;rules\u0026rdquo; of the society.\n  Coming to the specific case of \u0026ldquo;acquaintance on the facebook but not in real life,\u0026rdquo; I do not find anything odd here. In fact, I find it empowering that acquaintances could be made even without knowing each other in real life. It is for the first time human-history that you can cooperate and collaborate with others, on a large and expansive scale, even without knowing them in real life. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to have commonalities like religion, nationalities, ideologies and any other collectivities to come together and cooperate with each other. Cooperation is not predicated on external factors which are not in your control but internal factors that you can control. A person from Pakistan can send me a friend request on facebook, and if I want, I can become his friend and vice-versa. The acquaintance or the friendship, in this case, was established just because two persons wanted to become friends. How improbable this sounds without internet, in the complex realities of our time?\n  Coming to your regret about not talking to them with the same passion in real life, I think here the critical factor being emphasized by you is the emotional content of these acquaintances. That the emotionality of it all is diminishing is what you want to say. But the emotion is just an after-effect. It is not the cause. You become friend with someone because you find something good in them for you and hence better cooperation. That in the end, you develop emotional attachments is just a side-effect in my view. Sometimes these emotions may create a feedback loop and ensure even better cooperation, like two lovers getting married. But unmindful emotions may lead to undesired consequences too, like hyper-nationalists going berserk in their common love for the country. I think, as long as the cause of cooperation is understood well, side-effects like emotions can be controlled or channeled in a better way.\n  Techno-humanism aims to enhance human\u0026rsquo;s life using technology and binds humanity in a novel way that breaks the shackles of boundaries between nations, religious differences, and any other differences. In this respect at least, social media like facebook, twitter have done well, irrespective of whether it was their motive or not. Traditional relationships which we are most familiar with are undergoing a paradigm shift, and it\u0026rsquo;s again just a reflection of the changing times.\n  \u0026ndash;It is getting long. :P I hope my ramblings did not bore you. Hope to have a wide discussion on it over a cup of tea sometime. :D\n ","date":1519430400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1519430400,"objectID":"feadfd4cafec0abba651a2dc48ea7ec3","permalink":"https://orkohunter.net/letters/the-era-of-fake-acquaintance/","publishdate":"2018-02-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/letters/the-era-of-fake-acquaintance/","section":"letters","summary":"I wrote Something provocative happened with me yesterday.

It is good to note that the default setting of Facebook is to be private with posts and Twitter to be open to the web. While managing the Facebook and Twitter account of an organization I am involved in, I noticed a serious design pattern involved in displaying the public posts and their stark differences.\nCase 1: Stages of interacting with Twitter If you open a public tweet in incognito mode, or while being logged out, you’ll land on something like this —\nStage 1 of interaction consists of the content of the tweet with the highest visibility, followed by who created the tweet, then more details about the tweet. At this point of time, there is no available “Sign Up” button to be clicked. You can now easily close the tab since most of the times, your purpose would be the information contained in the tweet.\nBut if you feel engaged and you click on the close button on the top right corner, you’ll land on the profile page of the account which created the tweet, which I call the Stage 2.\nYou can see that the majority percentage of the web page is covered with the profile information. On the sidebar and header, there are interactive elements which lead you to sign up on the platform. And you would do, if you seem impressed. Let’s have a look at Facebook.\nCase 2: Stages of interacting with a public post on Facebook\nIf you open a public post on Facebook, you land on something like this —\nIt’s interesting to notice that much more than half of the area is covered with ways to either join or log in to Facebook. And the Stage 1 has zero information about the post (which was the sole purpose of opening that particular URL). The only way to close this banner is to find that tiny Not Now text below the big Green Create New Account. An interesting design flaw (whether intentional or by mistake) is that the typography of Not Now and Forgotten Account? is exactly the same, even when the later button is clicked once a hundred times and the former 99 out of 100 times. I think it’s intentional.\nLet’s click on Not Now, and move the Stage 2 of the view.\nOn this webpage, the area covered with the information about the post is still comparable or maybe less than the engageble area of log in and sign up. It’s funny to note that there are five interactive buttons on this single web page to Join Facebook.\nConclusions: — Facebook’s main focus is on targeting as many people as they can, while Twitter’s main focus does not appear so. Even if both the products want users, Facebook is desperately user-hungry in public.\n— Content is not respected on Facebook while Twitter values the content over anything else. Eventually content dies out on Facebook while people keep retweeting and referring 5 year old tweets.\nThank you for reading.

Some got the success while some are still trying. But to my astonishment, I found that the degree of comfort in each one of them was not as expected. What I mean by that is, not everyone who got this success was happy, and not everyone who failed was sad, although the majority was skewed on the side of the former case.\nAs I broadened my perspective and timeframe, I found that getting a job which pays in money, is not something which can give satisfaction to every human being. We cannot universally advise this to everyone. If you think so, then please understand the gravity of human population on this planet, and my concern was about satisfaction which is difficult to define, since a large part of it loses touch with materialism.\nSo, I aligned my line of thought with loving the work we do. If a farmer spends the day on their field, and they enjoy it, then it’s good, isn’t it? How about the software engineer who thinks their technology can help people or maybe due to some other reason, they find love in the code, they write? I found that it was closer to being a ubiquitous activity which can keep people happy, or at least a large number of humans. But then, I saw people who do not have any job at first place. By job, I mean an activity which benefits people and provides something (e.g. salary) in return for the individual. But there are wanderers, fakirs, hitchhikers and many types of unemployed people. So, are they different from regular? These people challenged the universality of this line of thought.\nIt further gave me an idea that instead of (or along with) loving the work, we also need to enjoy with the peers who surround us. So, a lot of human beings are embraced by their parents, friends and/or children. It does not happen always, but we can still find some of these in different bandwidths of our life. It reminded me of the letter by Richard Feynman, Do not remain nameless to yourself. So yeah, Living in love can be a universal thing to do. And it allowed me to picture this massive population of ours on the planet earth. But then, I found exceptions. I thought of Chris McCandless (Into the wild) and how he did not find love in his family but Nature.\nA scene from the movie Into the WildI was back to square one. Do we need another human being to live this life, happily? People can not always surround us. And further, outside of seven billion humans, there are other lives as well. What about dogs, or the trees, plants, and flowers which are alive? Or a lost animal somewhere in the jungle. Do they have to have a peer to share the love or their pursuit of happiness?\nMy problem set got bigger, and I appreciated how difficult it must be for a democracy to form its constitution or King Hammurabi to write his code. At this point, I felt a little exhausted in finding the answer to my question (it had been several months by now).\nBut a few days ago, as I was practicing Vipassana Meditation, I had an epiphany about the question. I realized how much did I miss to observe about my own physical body even when there was so much going on already. I never noticed my breath on its whole (trust me, when I say, I still have not). The moment we start to breathe in, and it goes on for a full length, and then it stops. A moment of no activity, and then we breathe out. And the cycle repeats. Breathing is just one of the many involuntary signs of life, and yet it goes on unnoticed. It made me regard the totality around me, even more. To mention a few, the breeze which blows past me when I stroll on 2.2, the distant sound I listen to while typing this text, the leaves which fall off from the trees when I sit with a cup of chai at Bhaski’s, and other many signs of life.\nI think, for the question of “What is something which should be the universal action of everyone?”, I can put it in words as “To witness”. We necessarily do not have to think, question, or react to the activities around us or even inside us, but to just witness the presence of life. In Sanskrit, we call this state of no-mind as निर्विचार. I felt that generally, we are ignorant of ourselves and we miss to observe a lot. With this awareness and focus, the decisions we make are quite apparent, and we can then work on optimizing our limited time on this planet to do something.\n","date":1517097600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1517097600,"objectID":"2ae654212c6bea7cfced5daa11cf21f1","permalink":"https://orkohunter.net/blog/quest-for-universal-action/","publishdate":"2018-01-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/quest-for-universal-action/","section":"blog","summary":"You may listen to this while reading We Are All Astronauts - Ether (YouTube).\nFew months ago, a significant percentage of my peers were involved in the process of getting a job or an internship, including me.

I was travelling. The same winter vacations, 30 days, and the curiosity of what to do with it. It\u0026rsquo;s astonishing for the old-me that I have no tech goals this time. I have been learning Guitar for a month and hence I tend to practice daily. On the other hand, I have goals of losing weight (lost 6 kgs in 45 days) and hence I\u0026rsquo;m determined to maintain the daily calorie deficit. One of my cousin sisters at home (in :place-name-retracted:) gave birth to a little girl yesterday and I\u0026rsquo;m planning to spend some time with them too! So yeah, this December it\u0026rsquo;s mostly about being with close people and few goals which I\u0026rsquo;ve wanted to achieve for a long time.\nLately, my thoughts have been revolving around this particular letter1 of Feynman. In which he says, \u0026ldquo;No problem is too small or too trivial if we can really do something about it.\u0026rdquo;. Reading this letter gives me tremendous relief because it settled down some of my uneasiness about something which relates to KGP itself. The general idea of MetaKGP as a group, for me, is a solution to the problem we have in KGP of closed societies and very little collaborative nature among a majority of people. (Of course, it means more). While I understood this problem very clearly, there is always more which have been troubling me since my first year. I still do not understand all of them, but few are \u0026ldquo;the troubled hierarchy and senior-junior relationship in our halls and societies\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;lack of human interactions about life and work both\u0026rdquo;. I always have so many people with whom I am able to talk about technology and so many other people with whom I am able to talk about philosophy, but I only have two or three friends with whom I can freely talk both at the same time, which in fact is the real me. And I always believed, for this to take place, we will have to do more than meeting online. (I am literally shaking at this point but this does not reflect on the words I have written so far. That\u0026rsquo;s why I love human interactions more, where more senses are at work than just reading text)\nAt this point in time in my KGP life, I am certain that it is so much more helpful when you have good seniors with whom you can meet occasionally, curious peers with whom you discuss the questions. I have been blessed to get all of them, the likes of you and :name-retracted:. But this does not happen to everyone. I firmly believe there are people (like me) in my batch, who did not meet enough [insert-an-adjective abstracted by \u0026lsquo;good\u0026rsquo;] seniors (like I met) and now they come around and call a fellow friend \u0026ldquo;stud\u0026rdquo; while I just wish to join them and not create boundaries and levels between us. One of them ended his life ten months ago. And there are probably more living with the following thoughts. Just to add, I am absolutely not asking everyone to become a tech guy and get seniors who do open source. Few of the best people I have met in KGP do not belong to tech. And it should be like this.\nBUT, here is an interesting fact. A majority of my friends who are responsible, who try to understand about life, who are really enjoying this journey are associated with Collaborating in groups and/or doing Open Source software. And I believe this has to be one of the solutions for (some) people and could really help them. My motive to create a closed group of people who understand this problem and are willing to help others, the initiative of KWoC, the sessions etc. are just a bigger picture to my very small zeal of increasing more human interactions in KGP. It\u0026rsquo;s disheartening when a lot of my friends do not understand the efforts or simply do not care.\nExcuse me for some arrangement of words which can be put together in a more readable manner and losing my brevity. But I have not talked about this to anyone, except :name-retracted: and that too only once. It will take time for me to organize these thoughts.\nSo, How is life?\n1 http://www.lettersofnote.com/2015/10/do-not-remain-nameless-to-yourself.html?m=1\n Response from :name-retracted:  Hey, Thanks a lot for writing this, the pleasure of receiving a letter isn\u0026rsquo;t something I get often. So, How is life for me?\n  Such broad questions are easy to ask and way hard to answer, that\u0026rsquo;s why I mostly receive the answer \u0026ldquo;good!\u0026rdquo;. Right now I\u0026rsquo;m listening to Blackstratblues, in another tab I have django documentation open which I have to use to complete to order to complete the screening process of Toptal 1, and I have been thinking about ways machine learning is wrong I have attached a writeup. I just finished this book called \u0026ldquo;The Black Swan\u0026rdquo; by Nassim N. Taleb you should totally read it, on surface it is about limits of knowledge but I find him to be very profound and his philosophies connect everything in life and universe. He isn\u0026rsquo;t a I know it all pundit rather he talks about what you don\u0026rsquo;t know, what you cannot know and what can you do about it. Of course, as with any book and any author you don\u0026rsquo;t have to agree with everything or even anything the author says but the book will give you a new perspective. I was about to say this perspective is \u0026ldquo;helpful\u0026rdquo; then I remembered my own writing on :blogpost-retracted:.\n  The days just after quitting the job were pretty stressful, my parents even convinced me take back my resignation at one point, but now I\u0026rsquo;m glad out of it. My biggest fear at job was that I\u0026rsquo;ll get trapped in it, sure I didn\u0026rsquo;t like it, I found it to be boring and whatever, but I know myself and I know that I adapt to things slowly as weeks turned into months, months would have turned into years and I would learned to like the job the way it is, extra money, suits, the \u0026ldquo;prestige\u0026rdquo; I had started to develop a taste for them. After sometime that fact that this job was something that I never wanted would have faded way and I would have accepted the most boring parts as part of the parcel, thinking what better can I get. Though it might not look that way from outside, quitting the job was REALLY hard for me, in conventional terms it was the best job I could have got, though I was very clear that this job was not something I wanted but the question was if not this then what? I saw no natural transition either, I interviewed with :company-name-retracted: for tech lead and they didn\u0026rsquo;t take me. One day I was pretty frustrated, I thought if I don\u0026rsquo;t quit now then I\u0026rsquo;ll never be able to quit. I thought about the reasons I should stay, none of them were strong enough, so I resigned next day.\n  About opensource, I don\u0026rsquo;t have much to add to add to what you said. Just as you are glad to find us, I\u0026rsquo;m glad to find you. As you did, sometimes I look back and realize that I have really really lucky. Things would have been way different if I didn\u0026rsquo;t meet :name-retracted: and :name-retracted: in school, things would have been way different if I, :name-retracted: and :name-retracted: wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have been my wingies, things would have been way different I hadn\u0026rsquo;t discovered :name-retracted:\u0026rsquo;s blog before coming to KGP which lead to me to discover KLUG. There are many many such lucky things which have happened. Of course there are people who are luckier than me, but there are so many others who aren\u0026rsquo;t. I think it is our responsibility to share this luck so that others can get a chance to get lucky like we did.\n   ","date":1513468800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1513468800,"objectID":"02c7c2c97e80882e0196c1e93abd598b","permalink":"https://orkohunter.net/letters/response-to-how-is-life/","publishdate":"2017-12-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/letters/response-to-how-is-life/","section":"letters","summary":"I was asked \u0026ldquo;How is Life?\u0026rdquo; over chat by someone and I thought of responding with a letter.\n Hello :name-retracted:,\nI am sorry it took me so long to respond to you.

Anyway, I completed it. And then wrote a little more on the wiki (I was copying what everyone was doing), but still the memories I cherished about MetaKGP came from the meetings we had, where we discussed possible projects.

(At the time I was recently introduced to ML, had mentored the winter workshop on CV)\n  Then came the third year, I think there was a phase shift. Suddenly we were focussing a little more on advertising MetaKGP. It is necessary that people get to know about MetaKGP and our projects, but we were focussed more on advertising than creating value. I am not undermining the ongoing projects, Naarad came to completion during this time, MFQP-source was going strong.

At the same time, Inter-IIT and Inter-Hall OpenSoft were going on, I won\u0026rsquo;t go into much detail but I was very busy. I wrote my proposal in a train journey and sent it to :name-retracted:, I believed that I was going to lose. Even in the vote, I gave myself lowest priority. But thank god I was chosen as a maintainer, I have learned so many things in my tenure.\n  But this also meant that I had to fulfill what I had written in my proposal (Please don\u0026rsquo;t rebuke on this point, I know it is naive of me to think so), So I started the :slack-channel-name-retracted: channel cause I knew that due to my interest I would read about ML and DL every day and hence posting regularly about it would be easier. And I conducted the :event-name-retracted:, I justified myself that I would get to know how senior people work and think. I learnt a great deal from the :event-name-retracted: but accepting their failure, none of them attracted more people to slack. Most of the people who came to :event-name-retracted: were on my personal invitation, even sharing from GymK page didn\u0026rsquo;t help.\n  In the summers, :name-retracted: had shifted everything to docker, I thought that this is the time that I can learn about docker and maybe help. I tried to install it, fix some issue. I got stuck somewhere and I left. It was frustrating to work on docker, I just accepted defeat that I won\u0026rsquo;t be of much use for the server.\n  Now coming to this year: :name-retracted:, :name-retracted:, :name-retracted:, Himanshu, :name-retracted:, :name-retracted: and :name-retracted:, all of them had been great with me. But we were discussing more and working less. As I have fresh memories for this semester, I can recall that we talked about course reviews but never got them, we talked about a fresher intro we never gave, we talked about myriad things we never did. For me, this clearly shows how I failed as a maintainer. I didn\u0026rsquo;t criticize anyone, this is not a good practice. I tried to work on projects: the :project-name-retracted:(a naive project), the :project-name-retracted:(it was almost completed, I mean it builds and runs, but as CIC already caches YT it is not of much use). We got traffic for MFQP-source (IMO this was awesome on the part of :name-retracted: and :name-retracted: for getting this feat). I contributed to the wiki, hoped that this might inspire people to contribute more.\n  From my experiences, I would try to draw conclusions:\n  It was foolish of me to believe that bringing more people on slack would help MetaKGP, Until and unless we create value there won\u0026rsquo;t be much to bind us. I don\u0026rsquo;t think we need a lot of people for MetaKGP if we have only 3-5 people from each batch that would be more than enough. We need to promote the Hacker culture in KGP, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t specifically means promoting MetaKGP. We conducted few small lightning talk session amongst us friends this semester, I learnt a lot from that. We at MetaKGP need to stop branding ourselves as a society for everyone, We are (or have become) a technical society whose people have interest in everything. We need to focus more on projects, we, maintainers, created a small roadmap in our last meeting.\n  [Incomplete and left]\n  I responded - Hey :name-retracted:,\nIt is hard for me to write the words I am about to. It is hard for me to maintain brevity due to multiple strong emotions attached to the subjects. But here I go.\nWhile reading your message, One thing that I felt is best described as Sorry. Yeah. I am sorry I did not support you enough on the cab ride with :name-retracted:, even when I wanted to. I am sorry I did not contest in the elections with you or justified my stance publicly of why not to. I am sorry I mostly acted as if \u0026ldquo;you are supposed to\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;I might voluntarily\u0026rdquo; for various tasks, events, and responsibilities. This is not how things work. On one hand, we are trying to get new and enthusiastic people, while at the same time, due to the same actions, MetaKGP is turning other people off, who already existed. I am one of them.\nCan I tell you something about Kharagpur Winter of Code? :name-retracted: has started growing a bad taste for it. His problem is \u0026ldquo;Why are we coaching people for GSoC? We should be promoting hardcore Open Source instead.\u0026rdquo; This is where I differ and agree with him at the same time. Yes, we should be promoting hardcore Open Source. But what would be the perfect strategy? Engineers with jobs, when they have an upfront deadline to ship a product and they need a simple NLP date time parser in Python, they don\u0026rsquo;t go and write one library, they find it on GitHub, which saves their ass. And thereafter, when they create something useful, they return the favor to open source by maintaining projects like React, Angular, etc. So, the question is, why in this world, would any 18-year-old college student would do such thing? What is the value the kid sees? If you promote hardcore open source, 5 out of 1500 would come and 1 would stay. If you promote Google Summer of Code, 400 out of 1500 would come and 30 would stay. And out of those 30, you can definitely be certain that more than 1 would continue doing open source. So, this is what I said to :name-retracted:, \u0026ldquo;This is not a model which we invented for KGP, this is a model which Larry Page and Sergey Brin created in 2004. Even they resorted to money, incentives, and glamour to get more students into open source. We are still young, to solve this problem.\u0026rdquo;\nOne of my perspectives for MetaKGP is the same. It is trying to help students without giving any sustainable incentive, and hoping they would stick together. No, they won\u0026rsquo;t. I still go back to the group because I know that some people in there share the same passion for Software as I do. Why are we not working on developing that passion? Why are we not passionate about creating things anymore? Small things, doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter, but it should be solving the problem of at least one person. Let us do that! Let us empower more beginners to achieve this. Second years like :name-retracted: and \u0026ldquo;name-retracted: have such bright college life ahead, they do things which less than 1% of their batch would be able to comprehend. This is what we should be doing. And people like :name-retracted: and :name-retracted: are their inspirations when they do these things. The people who inspire them, just don\u0026rsquo;t know how they are helping others without actually willing to.\nI believe the \u0026ldquo;problem with MetaKGP\u0026rdquo; began when :name-retracted: misunderstood it. He started believing that promoting MetaKGP will solve all the problems because it represents the core concept of Freedom in software and a war against proprietary things (in this case, closed KGP societies and Hall culture). The concept of being open to everyone and hierarchy, all routed his passion towards promoting MetaKGP. It was hard to argue with him because he had forgotten what it feels to be the first year and knowing rat shit about these technologies and ideas. He had lost the concept of being a guide to juniors long time ago and he became a friend to everyone. Alas, that was never going to solve the issue. Willingly or unwillingly, everyone started spreading \u0026ldquo;word\u0026rdquo; about MetaKGP.\nBut if you read :name-retracted:\u0026rsquo;s :article-name-retracted: you will find the motive \u0026quot;:exact-words-retracted:\u0026quot; For me,\n Collaboration comes when we work together to organize a big event, not one person contacting people to come and speak. Collaboration is when someone messages you \u0026ldquo;I will take care of this\u0026rdquo;, but you insist on sharing the work because you know they would get exhausted by the amount of work involved and they just said it because they are junior to you. Openness is when we freely respond to juniors and batchmates \u0026ldquo;Yaar room pe aa ja kabhi bhi; Chal milte hain; Yaha se padh le\u0026rdquo;. Two days ago, I met 3 unknown juniors from RK. They wished to open a startup of memes. They didn\u0026rsquo;t know what GET/POST requests are. I told them everything, how they can use MVC, databases, image editing with js, apps, security of servers. I left them with the suggestion, \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t do this if you are aiming for users, do this because you want this product to be alive, do it just for the sake of creating it. Users will follow. And even if they don\u0026rsquo;t, you\u0026rsquo;ll never regret the fact of creating something.\u0026rdquo; I spent 2 hours with them and comforted them to approach me anytime in future. I guess that would be openness. I did not add them to KOSS or MetaKGP because it will not help them as of now, and they would probably be a victim of inferiority complex, as a lot of my friends were when I added them to KLUG in my first year. I was different and developed the false belief that this was the correct way and hence it would work for everyone. Self-improvement is when we read a trending article about git, python, (some particular ML algorithm) even if we know so much about it; because we thrive for that last 20-30% we don\u0026rsquo;t know about it, that particular method or that command. And then we share stuff in places like ShowKGP. Curiosity is asking :name-retracted: \u0026ldquo;how is work?\u0026rdquo;, even when your inner self is telling you that you would not get a constructive answer.  In the :name-retracted:\u0026rsquo;s :article-name-retracted:, you can find an article about inclusivity - :exact-words-retracted:\nAlright, this is a good model. But it will fail when the \u0026ldquo;we\u0026rdquo; includes the one \u0026ldquo;who got into the phase of passive lack of exclusion\u0026rdquo;. Again, all I am resorting to is that promoting MetaKGP is a positive, attempt at solving a very difficult, abstract and huge problem in college. But no one ever questioned, should we really be doing that right now? For me, there are more existing problems in KGP which needs to be solved and they hold a higher priority. I have spent a lot of my time in KGP at solving those. You surely know all of it, and all of me in this regard.\nOut of nowhere, this reminds me of the recent movie Newton. It is a great drama which shows us that there is a limit to the extent of solving a problem and strategizing is very important rather than following the pure true way. If you have watched it, you should remember the crazy scene when Rajkumar Rao holds the gun in his hand. If you haven\u0026rsquo;t, I can quote a line from the movie \u0026ldquo;Sir, koi bhi change ek din mein nahi aata. Waqt lagta hai\u0026rdquo;. I can totally relate to :name-retracted:\u0026rsquo;s MetaKGP with the lead in the movie, who tries to solve everything instantly by doing it the pure way. Although it solves the problem upto some extent but is completely useless and can be solved in steps, in easier and more sustainable way.\nI have been writing this email for a long time now, and I think it can never be completed. I\u0026rsquo;ll get some tea now and hope to hear from you.\nPS. I was listening to Post Rock the whole time. ;)\n:name-retracted: responded -  Thanks Himanshu.\n  At the first place, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to be sorry for that.

But what people do now is that they post it on Instagram and then share it over Facebook. This is the most meaningless aspect of Facebook after pokes. Why do you expect someone to see (follow) your photos on Instagram if they do not know you at all? And if they do, you are definitely friends with them on Facebook.\n  Poorly composed pictures clearly showing you having fun Why do people start migrating away from Facebook? This happened when their friends started using Facebook as a PR tool, to estabilish that they are living a good life, irrespective of the reality.\n  Now, what would happen if you would post your party pictures, your fun trips stories on Instagram? Don’t they already have enough from you, on Facebook?\nHow to fix it? Quoting Nerdwriter1 here, “Before posting anything on the social media, think a little about Why you post what you post.”\nWe can have all of Flickr, 500px, Imgur on Instagram, with a better and more familiar social network. But like Hacker News and Reddit and unlike Facebook, it is **okay not to post, but just consume the beauty out of it. So, put the peer pressure off and enjoy following some amazing photographers on Instagram. And hey, it’s perfectly cool if you share your photography skills over there too ! It’s a social network after all. And it’s also alright if you click a cute picture of a child you spotted in a village. It’s great. Likeways, it’s okay if you post a picture of your own child. Or your spouse. Or your own. Hey wait, maybe I should watch the video again.\n**It’s okay to post a picture of a Human (and it’s not the same)\nNote that I don’t actually hate my friends on instagram. It’s just a momentary disgust, which vanishes away when I hangout with these amazing people.\nUpdate: I deleted my Facebook and Instagram account.\n","date":1488067200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1488067200,"objectID":"6df736a0f1e3d8d613a99479638fab68","permalink":"https://orkohunter.net/blog/instagram/","publishdate":"2017-02-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/instagram/","section":"blog","summary":"Watch this video from Nerdwriter1 Let\u0026rsquo;s Fix Instagram (YouTube).\nInstagram is Facebook, but only with a different purpose than connecting people, it’s about sharing photos.

Go to https://github.com. Pick a username, enter your email id and choose a password. Next, choose unlimited personal repositories for free. In the final step you can give some input to github and voila ! You are now a github user. (If you are redirect from KWoC, use the username there.) There is plethora of git guides over internet, some are really good and some really suck. I here am writing a simple blog for the newbies who have successfully made an account over github and are really excited about it.\n GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service, which offers some of the distributed revision control and source code management(SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. Unlike Git, which is strictly a command-line tool, GitHub provides a web-based graphical interface and desktop as well as mobile integration\nOr simply\nGithub connects you with other people who are interested in sharing and creating together.\nSo there are really two ways to begin with. Here goes the first one.\nCreate a repository : Repository is what you call the stuff you are going to upload and work on. Go to https://github.com/new and create a repository. Let’s name it hello-world. Add some description, or you might want to add it later. Initialize it with a Readme. It\u0026rsquo;s a good practice and let\u0026rsquo;s you clone it immediately. (Yeah right, see below)\nClone it : Open your console, move to the directory where you want to work and do this.\n$ git clone https://github.com/username/hello-world.git This will create a directory in your computer. Now, this isn’t a simple directory. It is a ‘clone’ of the github repository. You can say that the files in it are controlled by the version control system git and tracked with the repository on github. Note : If you have not installed git, see this.\nDo this,\n$ cd hello-world $ git remote -v origin https://github.com/\u0026lt;username\u0026gt;/hello-world.git (fetch) origin https://github.com/\u0026lt;username\u0026gt;/hello-world.git (push) This shows that the link to repository of yours at github is known by the name origin over here.\nNow, you will have to configure your name and your email address which you will be using for making the commits (don’t worry about what it means right now, we will cover it soon). This configuring is ideally done only once in a lifetime of your system (or unless you purposely remove your ~/.gitconfig file but that’s the story of another time).\n$ git config --global user.name \u0026quot;ABC XYZ\u0026quot; $ git config --global user.email \u0026quot;abc@xyz.com\u0026quot; Now another way of this is first you create the directory on your computer. Navigate inside it and do\n$ git init This will initialize an empty git repository inside it. Later, you can add the link to the repository by the git remote command like this\n$ git remote add origin https://github.com/\u0026lt;username\u0026gt;/hello-world You can always use git remote -v command to track the aliases.\nMaking the first change : Okay now we are in condition of adding some files or code to this repository. I am going to make a python file with hello world program and publish the change over the github repository too. So make a new file say hello.py inside the directory, open it with your favorite editor and write the one line code to print whatever you want. Why just hello world? (Because dmr did it!) Now write it and save the file.\nThe first thing you should always do is to see whether you have done any changes or not in the repository. This can be done by\n$ git status\nAfter the changes you made, you must be getting this after git status\nOn branch master Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'. Untracked files: (use \u0026quot;git add \u0026lt;file\u0026gt;...\u0026quot; to include in what will be committed) hello.py nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \u0026quot;git add\u0026quot; to track)Add, Commit, Push! : In your console, do this. $ git add . This adds all the files in the track which you have changed. Now it’s time to commit that change. By committing, git understands that you want the change to be in record. Every commit is accompanied with a message that appears on the log (git log). A commit should represent one logical change only which should be supported by a relevant commit message. The convention is to write the commit in the verbal form ie. tell the computer to do that for you. Do this\n$ git commit -m \u0026quot;add hello.py\u0026quot;\nYou’ve made your first commit! But it won’t be appearing over github, because you made the changes locally. You need to push it over the web. For that, you use\n$ git push\nOr,\n$ git push origin\nto say git where actually you are pushing it to. Or,\n$ git push origin master\nto say git over what branch on origin you are pushing it to.\nThat’s it! You’ve published your changes to your GitHub repository.\nNOTE : This is a very basic start. There are more concepts to be explored. You can search for specifics. StackOverflow also has great resources. We’ll leave the nitty gritties of Git for another day.\nHappy Coding!\n","date":1485302400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1485302400,"objectID":"52a8761ae1e5352e9aab8f5ca01d8910","permalink":"https://orkohunter.net/blog/quick-guide-to-git-and-github-1/","publishdate":"2017-01-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/quick-guide-to-git-and-github-1/","section":"blog","summary":"Before we start, make sure you have an account on GitHub.

Just 30 minutes later, when the crescent rays will fall on the black hood covering your face, when you’ll be tied with, or rather “in” a knot, for the second time of your life, believe me you would not want to be in haste. You don’t want them to see your eyes popped out, or your filthy tongue stuck out like a creep right? So, get up, go get your hair combed, your teeth cleaned, and most importantly collect as much happy thoughts as possible in your stupid brain.”\nThe only child of his parents, this kid was a loner, an antisocial introvert who liked to stay back in his shady living-slash-playing room, and wished to stay there for lifetime. Skipping school since the fourth grade, his mother very well accepted his social awkwardness as well as his mind’s disability and was happy with hiding it from the rest of the world. Whilst I, I watched him grow, I kept calling out for him, in his good times, or bad. I lived in him.\nWhen he was 10, his mother was relocated to a new place, around 50 kilometres from the capital, a place where neighbourhood was as far as the corner shop in the hometown. He was terrified. He had to greet the visitors all along. It was then, he met his first friend, a girl. After she came into his life, there was no shady place, in his house, or heart or anywhere. ‘I love when Vaidehi blinks and smiles at the same time’, he’d say to his mom. One day, it was evident to him, that Vaidehi had the most beautiful eyes he’d ever seen. I still remember how his mother must have felt when she would have realised that his son had one more best friend now.\nHis mother was long gone before he’d even think of proposing Vaidehi to marry. It was the same girl, the only girl he’d ever spoken two words to. He left his mother’s house and starting living with her at a completely new place. ‘I’ve kept your lunch in the kitchen, heat it carefully, okay? I’ll be back by 7', she used to say every morning to him, like a mother warning his kid before herself going out.\nApart from his “work from home” job, he was passionate about clicking pictures. Or rather, he liked to save the moments he was enjoying with her. Some days, he used to shuffle between them, recollect the memories, shed a few tears, curl up on the bed and just wait for her to come in the evening. He was also good at dodging off important calls.\nBest were the college days, when he started perceiving how real, the real world was. He was afraid on the first day. Four years later, he had a job, a “work from home” job, a girlfriend, and no family. But he had learnt how to ignore bullies and be in love, or at least that’s what he’d think.\n‘Come in the City Hospital ASAP. Your wife is here.’ Some lady spoke on the phone. The call was from Vaidehi’s number. He rushed out, alone in the traffic and around so many people. He was little mad at her, why she didn’t take time off work during her last months.\n‘It’s a baby girl’, The nurse announced.\n‘Let’s call her Gayatri’, Vaidehi said.\n‘That’s a beautiful name’\n‘It’s your mother’s.’\n‘Oh yes. Of course.’\nAs the Judge broke the nip of the pen, he declared : ‘According to the evidences presented by the accused himself and his self-admittance, the suspect, on charge of murdering his wife and his baby child, is hereby sentenced to be hanged till death on the month’s last day at sunrise. May God have mercy upon his soul.’\nShe was drunk. One day, when she came home. Or maybe high, he could not figure, he remembers, during college days, she had mentioned one of her female friend who was into heroin at those times.\nVaidehi’s call history. Her friend’s name in recent calls. She was definitely high.\nHe could not dare speak a word to her. He made sure the little girl is fast asleep.\nShe started abusing herself on daily basis. He was worried. He considered himself to be at fault. Maybe, she was not enjoying with him as much as he was. Maybe she didn’t love him like he did.\n‘Nah! That can’t be it.’\nGayatri got into kinder garden. More house chores. Vaidehi couldn’t find time to visit her friend these days. She did go to work, but usually cut short her work hours in the evening. She was not happy.\n‘I will make her feel good.’ Maybe one more kid? Maybe pregnancy will stop her from drugs? He knew if he’ll ask her, she would politely refuse or unwillingly agree considering her husband’s wish. Let it be an accident. Months passed, he started worrying. Nothing happened. How about a medical check-up?\n‘I’m sorry sir, but you are infertile’, the doc said.\nWithin seconds, the first face to appear in front of him, was of his cute little daughter, Gayatri.\nCall history. Her friend’s name is still there. Ring, ring. ‘Hello?’, a hoarse voice; shocked to the bottom of his hearts. It was of a man.\nThis is about the night, the night he became the “accused”. Vaidehi was chopping off vegetables in the kitchen. He was looking at Gayatri, smiling, wondering. He could not hold any longer. He sneaked in.\n‘Hey’\n*’Sorry I got late, had lots of pending work at office. Dinner would be ready soon. I’m preparing noodle soup and rice. *\n‘I had to talk to you about something. I am sorry.’\nShe stopped. ‘What happened?’\n‘I am sorry, I checked your email.’ His heartbeat racing fast.\n‘Why the fuck would you do that?! And so what?’. She put the knife back on the table and stepped towards him.\n‘I saw the notice from your office. They said you haven’t showed up in two weeks.’\nShe was Numb. His legs were trembling.\n‘Vaidehi, you love me right?’\n‘Yes’, her lips were straight.\nHe went straight to bed. Later that morning he woke up, to find himself alone. She was gone with Gayatri. The knife had cut real deep. It was a bloody mess. He fainted.\n“What type of a person you are! That woman had no love for you, but why are you still doing this for her? Just go home already.”\nThe thick rope got around his neck. Eyes closed, hood on, memories started flashing in. And then came the regret, the regret that he would have loved Gayatri more, both of them.\n","date":1484870400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1484870400,"objectID":"5412c7cb4e3487bbb90d8ef58e182acf","permalink":"https://orkohunter.net/blog/erotomania/","publishdate":"2017-01-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/erotomania/","section":"blog","summary":"“Hey Wake up!\nWake up, for you are left with just 30 more minutes.\nYou better sleep after this is over; rather that would be your only choice.

Due to my recent interests in Image Processing, I had made few Pull Requests to the scikit-image library, but it did not participate in GSoC. And that, after all those years of consecutive partcipation! (Yes I felt little sad.)\nSo, the day when Google announced the list of organizations, I started my “org hunt” ! And by the end of the day, I had sorted out the Python-only projects, which included the project Library of Time Series methods. The project was to make a library with methods useful to the research in X-ray astronomy. I was thrilled by the idea! Nevertheless, I was not much aware of the astronomical aspects of it.\nIn next 10–15 days, I submitted my proposal and few Pull Requests, among which I think refactoring the Lightcurve class helped me understand the core of the library. In the pre-GSoC period, I also contributed in establishing Continuous Integration with Travis for Unix and Appveyor for Windows. Meanwhile, Stingray, the library we were working on, was re-designed to become an Astropy affiliated package.\nIn the wee hours of April 23, the results were announced and I was selected! My primary and helping mentors were Daniela Huppenkothen and Matteo Bachetti, both from different time zones, which really helped me in getting my answers as soon as possible.\nIn the first ten days of the Community Bonding period, my end semester exams were going on. The main medium of the communication between my mentors and me was Slack. And I must say, we totally loved it.\nI started off with implementing Cross Spectra, basing to a lot of work that was previously done by Abigail Stevens. Later on, Coherence and Lags were added in the Crossspectrum class, along with their tests and docstring.\nAfter the mid-terms the major work was to add the Covariance spectra, and its “Averaged” counter part as well, along with errors for both. My final PR was to add the simple matrix of Dynamical Powerspectrum, which is open as of now.\nThroughout this period, I was able to open 22 Pull requests and push 116 commits to the main repository i.e. StingraySoftware/Stingray.\nOne thing that I would like to share, of many things which I learnt in this perioid, is that numpy booleans are little tricky. For e.g.\nIn []: np.isfinite(100) is True Out[]: False This is because np.isfinite or similar functions do not return the basic Python bool but an instance of numpy bool. And in the __eq__ magic method of the numpy bool class, it is evaluated to the Python booleans. And so, np.isfinite(100) == True would return True.\nThat is all for now. It was a great experience for me, and I am very thankful to Daniela, Matteo and Abigail for all the help during the summer.\nCheers!\n","date":1484870400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1484870400,"objectID":"e2d464d2ba430de0d0cdedcba341ed8e","permalink":"https://orkohunter.net/blog/gsoc2016-report/","publishdate":"2017-01-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/gsoc2016-report/","section":"blog","summary":"It began 5 months ago, in February.

And by the end of the day, I had sorted out the Python-only projects, which included the project Library of Time Series methods.","tags":null,"title":"Google Summer of Code 2016 Report : Stingray","type":"blog"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Tech"],"content":"I would like to share an interesting story of a problem which I’ve faced many times since I started using git. This story is about “losing and re-gaining trust on .gitignore”.\nEvent : Create a Python app. Run it, test it and Boom! Now it’s time to push it to GitHub.\ngit init . git remote add https://github.com/iamsosmart/notsomuch.git git push -u origin master Shit, Shit, Shit ! I wasn’t supposed to push the pyc files. Oh this looks so lame.\nIf you’re amateur enough, not to feel uncomfortable after pushing those files, you’re golden. Else, you’ll think of something called .gitignore which helps in ignoring unwanted files to be added in your git repository.\nYou’ll then search for a good gitignore file for Python and Google will give you exactly what you want, Python.gitignore.\nwget -O .gitignore https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/master/Python.gitignore git add -A git commit -m \u0026quot;Added .gitignore file\u0026quot; Now, you’ll try to remove the pyc files, using rm -rf *.pyc. But as soon as you\u0026rsquo;ll do this, (and if you\u0026rsquo;re using oh-my-zsh), you\u0026rsquo;ll see a cross on your prompt. That means, git has detected a change.\nBut wait? Why is git detecting changes to pyc files, when I’ve already added the gitignore!\nNow, if you’re me, you’ll feel betrayed by git. You’ll make a few calls and send messages to people, and say “gitignore is not obeying me”, and they’ll hang up on you, saying “it must be your fault”.\nBelieve me, even the “future me” would have said the same.\nSo, the problem is that once you have staged a file, gitignore won’t have anything to do with it. So, if you’ll remove the staged file (pyc files, in this case), git will say to you that you’ve deleted them.\nLater on, I googled the string “gitignore not working” and O thanks to stackoverflow, I was rescued.\nAfter adding the .gitignore, simply do this\ngit rm -rf --cached . git add . Or, instead of rm -rf *.pyc\n, I must have done\ngit rm -rf *.pyc\nTa-da ! And that’s when, my friends, the trust I have in git’s simplicity increased by a tini-tiny bit.\nThank you for reading.\nWhen a python script is compiled, it generates compiled code as pyc files, also called byte code.\n","date":1484870400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1484870400,"objectID":"2927d88c545d40bf8568028669585543","permalink":"https://orkohunter.net/blog/losing-and-regaining-truct-on-gitignore/","publishdate":"2017-01-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/losing-and-regaining-truct-on-gitignore/","section":"blog","summary":"I would like to share an interesting story of a problem which I’ve faced many times since I started using git.

There is no way this 7 years old editor is going to compete with 39 years old emacs and 15 years old fork of yet another 39 years old editor vi. Nevertheless, there’s much more to come.\nThe first thing that Sublime Text lovers say about vim and emacs is “Why should I open an editor which I don’t know how to get out of?” Fair enough. They are not mere text editors. They have built-in code to edit any external code. Isn’t that pretty? Well, you have to follow some steps to close it. (Or you can forcefully shut down your console anytime you want. No matter they are powerful, you belong to the human race.) They also have more powerful features which make its user’s life easy.\nBut before you’ll think of your easy life, they’ll make you hate your life first. As Pascal Precht in one of his blogs discuss about the learning curve wall of vim. Here is a picture which is very explanatory.\nThe next argument by emacs users are “We don’t like using touchpad and want everything right there in our editor, like mail, news, everything!”\nYou are great sir! But let me also tell you, you are rare and have wrong conclusion about sublime users. We aren’t fond of touchpad either! As of me, I survived a whole semester of college with my touchpad not working. But that doesn’t mean I moved to emacs or vim. subl to open, pgup pgdn and arrow keys for navigation, ctrl + s to save, ctrl + t for new tab, I mean I had got everything done with my keyboard and the fact is that Chrome also obeys these commands (or vice-versa). Imagine you scrolling through a webpage and wondering why j and k are not helping you.\nThe point I’m trying to make is why shouldn’t we encourage newbies to use the editor which makes their life really easy very fast so that they could simply learn how to code rather then learning how to code to code. Later on, let them decide whether they really dislike this editor and move on to something more challenging and I believe some people will surely move on to the challenging ones.\nBut I will surely not.
