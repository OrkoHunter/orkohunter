      <title>Live Asynchronously</title>

      <guid>https://orkohunter.net/blog/live-asynchronously/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I first heard the phrase &amp;ldquo;Live Asynchronously&amp;rdquo; in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/live-asynchronously-c8e7172fe7ea/&#34;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; written by the amazing Quincy Larson, the creator of freecodecamp.org.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my last blog post about &lt;a href=&#34;https://orkohunter.net/blog/spotify/&#34;&gt;Joining Spotify in Sweden&lt;/a&gt;, I wrote a bit about this. Here, I have written more about what living asynchronously means to me. I have put some concrete examples from life where I have used this philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;define-asynchronous&#34;&gt;Define Asynchronous&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have understood Asynchronous in programming but &lt;a href=&#34;%5Bhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchrony%5D(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchrony)&#34;&gt;Asynchrony&lt;/a&gt; has more (similiar) meanings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my earliest days with Javascript, I remember being stuck one time. In my program I was doing an API request. Irrespective of whether the request was successful, my variable to store the API response was always &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt;. I was in my first year of college and I expressed my frustration to my brother with &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Javascript sucks&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;. All he said was &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Remember, Javascript is asynchronous.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; And that fixed the issue! I still see such problems and they get fixed by the &lt;em&gt;Remember&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the beginners face this problem with Javascript in their early days because Javascript is async in nature. This is unlike Python, which is a imperative (procedural) language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;difference&#34;&gt;Difference&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us take this short example of a program to understand the difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
1. Say &amp;quot;Hello World&amp;quot;.
2. *API request to fetch an image from the internet.
3. Based on the response of the request, store the image.
4. Calculate 1 + 1.

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a procedural language like Python or C/C++, all the 4 lines will be executed one after the other. The lines 3 and 4 will be executed only when line 2 has completely finished (network request has completed). But, it could take a second or more to complete that request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our program will spend most of its time at line 2 waiting for the network request to finish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, in an asynchronous language like Javascript, we will write the program differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
1. Say &amp;quot;Hello World&amp;quot;.
2. *API request to fetch an image from the internet.
3.              (Callback) Based on the response of the network request, store the image.
4. Calculate 1 + 1.

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, line 1 will be executed as usual. In line 2, we will do the API request. But, this time we are not going to wait around for the response. We will immediately move on to Line 4 and execute it. When the network call in line 2 finishes, we will execute the &amp;ldquo;callback&amp;rdquo; assigned to it in line 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Asynchronous programming comes into the picture for the blocks of code which take significant time to execute i.e. something which blocks the procedural execution of the main program.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sending an internet request, reading/writing to a file or a database takes way more time than calculating 1 + 1. So, we write a &amp;ldquo;callback function&amp;rdquo; for our asynchronous block of code. The callback decides what to do when the network request or the I/O operation completes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise&#34;&gt;Promise in Javascript&lt;/a&gt; has the same philosophy and is more powerful than callbacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-philosophy&#34;&gt;The Philosophy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans and computers function in an extraordinarily similar fashion. The I/O (Input/Output) operation for a computer is to talk to other computers. The I/O operation for us is to talk to other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blocks the main program. It means there is a chunk of time that it takes away from the main program for as long as the blocking execution is being done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These I/O operations are necessary for us to survive and communicate. They happen frequently and are also time-consuming. It then becomes important for us to manage them well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Living Asynchronously is us making sure our I/O operations are asynchronous most of the time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;applying-the-philosophy&#34;&gt;Applying the philosophy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;year-2004-age-7&#34;&gt;Year 2004 Age 7&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember in my school, our Maths textbooks used to have many questions in the form of exercises. An exercise was a collection of questions on one topic. There used to be dozens of chapters and hundreds of exercises in a book. The year-long school curriculum and timeline were to make sure all the chapters and their exercises get completed by the students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, the entire batch of students is synchronised on what exercise they are doing. Let&amp;rsquo;s say the teacher decides that this week, we are going to complete the Exercise 21 based on the basic Trigonometric formulae. By Monday next week, It is expected of the students to have their notebooks up-to-date. That&amp;rsquo;s how synchronous programming works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This model is not great. Not everyone in the class needs to follow the pace set by the teacher for what they deem is suitable for the class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was in the 3rd standard (age 7), my father started teaching Maths to my elder brother and me. (Fun fact: All three of us now do programming for a living!). It was 2004. In the summer before the school would begin, dad had set the target for me to solve all the problems in the book I was going to study that year. I loved the experience! Although it took a lot of time from my summer vacation, it was rewarding. And I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to stop there. Dad noticed this and bought me the maths textbooks for the following years. And this went on until in the 7th standard, I was doing the problems of the Maths book used in the 10th class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had followed the synchronous philosophy of the school, I would have to sit around throughout the year, learning not much new. A decade after that time, I would consciously start living asynchronously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;working-in-college-societies&#34;&gt;Working in college societies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in college, for five years I was part of a &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.metakgp.org/w/Technology_Literary_Society&#34;&gt;literary society&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/kossiitkgp&#34;&gt;a club&lt;/a&gt; to promote open source. These were two separate groups and I was an active member of both! In my 3rd/4th year, I was part of the so called &amp;ldquo;executive batch&amp;rdquo;. We were 4-5 people responsible to execute the events organized by 30-50 of us members, for the hundreds of students on campus to attend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we organized any event (a poetry night, an open mic, a Python or a GSoC workshop, etc.), I as the organizer needed to sync with all the members helping out. There are many operations that need to be taken care of, like logistics, publicity, poster distribution, members&amp;rsquo; performances/talks, communication with external members, finances, etc. If I remember correctly, I had burnt out early in the year. I had to sync with so many people during the days of the actual event. I valued the event&amp;rsquo;s success not much by its attendance, but a lot by how we did it and the things we learned in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets take the task of poster distribution. The job was to print a bunch of posters for the event that had its details, description, contact, venue, time, etc. and paste it across the college campus so that other students would notice. From the team, I would assign one person to take care of this. This meant that they were responsible for going to the printing press, getting the copies done, and then with the help of other members, putting them up across the campus. Given I had other equally important tasks to take care of, it was a nightmare to contact all the people involved in this particular task. But, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t just &amp;ldquo;assign and forget&amp;rdquo; the task to someone because, if he or she decided to slack off, it would disrupt the event. This has happened quite many times as I remember. So, I started identifying people I could trust, who shared the passion of the work and cared. And then, living asynchronously was easy and the only sane way to go about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Then on, all my instructions and tasks had their &lt;em&gt;callbacks&lt;/em&gt;. And if someone else asked me to do something, I would ask them to write their &lt;em&gt;callback&lt;/em&gt; i.e. tell me what to do when I&amp;rsquo;m done with this. I reduced many unnecessary &amp;ldquo;blocking&amp;rdquo; I/O operations from my life, resulting in a much relaxed life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;whatsapp-message-seen-tick&#34;&gt;WhatsApp message &amp;ldquo;seen&amp;rdquo; tick&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many years ago Facebook started showing things like &amp;ldquo;message seen at 10:10 AM&amp;rdquo; in their chatbox. This was the first time I saw something like this. Earlier, messaging someone was much like sending a very short email - you didn&amp;rsquo;t expect a response within a minute. Instant communication started catching up and now there is a product called &amp;ldquo;mail tracker&amp;rdquo; which tells you when and how many times your email was read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have disabled the blue seen tick in WhatsApp and I have a &lt;a href=&#34;https://orkohunter.net/blog/delete-facebook/&#34;&gt;dummy facebook account&lt;/a&gt;. This means, I don&amp;rsquo;t get to know when my message was read and the other person doesn&amp;rsquo;t know when I read their message. This is me, trying to reduce &amp;ldquo;synchronous&amp;rdquo; communication from life, as it introduces more problems than it solves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If someone &lt;em&gt;sees&lt;/em&gt; my message, I never ought to expect an instant response. I have no idea what they are doing in their &amp;ldquo;main program&amp;rdquo;. They could be in a thought process, talking with someone else, working on something, or be in one of a thousand different possibilities. So &amp;ldquo;seen at 10:10 AM&amp;rdquo; gives me no information. It instead triggers me to think - &lt;em&gt;why have they not replied yet&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I want to have a synchronous conversation, I would set up a call at the convenience of both of us. That is much efficient in every aspect. By not having to worry about replying instantly and not expecting someone to do so, I have freed a lot of time that I used to waste in waiting for the response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;relationships-and-behaviour&#34;&gt;Relationships and Behaviour&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I have the freedom of my thoughts, asynchrony is associated with freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If our actions and words demand synchronous response from the other person, it directly impacts their time. It affects how they want to spend it. Doing it way often is not nice. And it is a kind gesture to respect their time and do less synchronous communication. Allowing someone to be free is a great expression of love and it makes us better humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would be crazy to say that all synchronous communications are bad. That would be insane. What I do is reduce the frequency, and increase the time to generate more value. And of course, do lots of async stuff. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;blog-post-vs-notifications&#34;&gt;Blog post vs Notifications&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A blog post is a shining example of communicating asynchronously in this world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog post does not demand anything from you. You can close it as soon as you opened it, read it now, a week later or next year. I have no expectation of knowing whether you read it or not, unless you want to let me know. I enjoy writing and reading them. They do not feel &amp;ldquo;instant&amp;rdquo;. They do not say &amp;ldquo;just now&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;posted a minute ago&amp;rdquo;. As Quincy Larson says - all notifications are synchronous. Social media wants to notify me if someone has said something publicly. Facebook/Instagram/Twitter wants to keep me in &amp;ldquo;sync&amp;rdquo; with what all my friends are doing. However, this blog post will sit here on this website. And if someone wants to see if I have written something new, it will be discovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; going to tweet a link to this blog post. That will be synchronous. Oh, the hippocracy! ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;remote-work-promotes-living-asynchronously&#34;&gt;Remote work promotes living asynchronously&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before my first job started, I was convinced that by introducing more asynchrony in life, I am saving my time and energy and I am being happier. When I started working, I had the challenge of adopting the same philosophy at work. I knew it would be challenging because people have their own style of working. But I tried my best to keep this philosophy alive with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I would have technical queries to ask, most of them would be Email or Slack and few in-person. As I understood the team and the technologies better over time, I would change all my questions to being asynchronous. That kept everyone involved a bit happier. The person who&amp;rsquo;d write the answer, would do so in their free time. Hence the responses had more details and helped me more than what a disrupting synchronous question would have done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a project is newborn, synchronous communication between the stakeholders and engineers is necessary and valuable. They help avoid confusion and misunderstandings. But as the tasks start being granular, sync-meetings begin losing their value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a project has grown large and has no documentation, there is no way asynchronous communication is possible even after months or years. The few people who created it, are going to waste more time answering questions, which they should have written in the form of documentation ages ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, product managers love to talk about projects in team meetings. Why won&amp;rsquo;t they? They have a vision and want to share. But a wise engineering manager would come and ask, &amp;ldquo;Can this information be shared via an email?&amp;rdquo;. This is a smart question to ask each time because it not only promotes written documentation but saves time for the involved engineers. They got time to focus and pay more attention to the work, which would have been disrupted by a synchronous meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to blog posts, Documentation of projects and code is a light beam of hope in the asynchronous life. If I can find the documentation to read, it drastically reduces the amount of synchronous communication involved to solve my problem. And since a tap on the shoulder in not possible when working remotely, more written communication is the way to go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tldr-too-long-didnt-read&#34;&gt;TLDR (Too long, didn&amp;rsquo;t read)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living Asynchronously is inspired by the concept of asynchronous programming and Javascript&amp;rsquo;s callbacks and promises. Synchronous life events are blocking in nature, are inefficient and time-consuming. It is not always possible, but living asynchronous life has its benefits and is a great way to live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe this philosophy is easy to understand and can be applied on many aspects of life. I encourage you to think on your own and identify the synchronous events in life. And then imagine how living asynchronously would feel.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Joining Spotify in Sweden</title>
      <link>https://orkohunter.net/blog/spotify/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 22 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://orkohunter.net/blog/spotify/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://orkohunter.net/img/spotify.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://newsroom.spotify.com/media-kit/logo-and-brand-assets/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image source&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;life-in-japan&#34;&gt;Life in Japan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the things that I knew about Japan turned out to be true, as soon as I arrived here 8 months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan is a &lt;strong&gt;beautiful&lt;/strong&gt; place to live! The &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry_blossom&#34;&gt;cherry blossoms&lt;/a&gt; season just started. There is a lot of nature surrounding downtown Tokyo. I haven&amp;rsquo;t experienced the peak of summer here yet, but the cold climate has been cherry on top of it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent five years in my college campus where you could spot trees from anywhere (my hostel room, classrooms and the roads). Having all this nature around me once again was a relief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most &lt;strong&gt;people are mindful, quiet and private&lt;/strong&gt;. This is great for those who want to live a private life. I believe my friends and I used to be the only ones talking in the entire freaking train.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delicacies&lt;/strong&gt;! I don&amp;rsquo;t remember having a bad meal ever. The proportion size and the amount of calories are thoughtfully decided. The meals are prioritized to be healthy &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; tasty. This is not true for many countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan is very &lt;strong&gt;safe&lt;/strong&gt;. I know many of my friends never locked their apartments before going out (bad idea). Walking outside late at nights does not feel threatening. I am raised to be careful about incoming traffic and being stoic about what could go wrong. Certainly, I have never had any bad experience. I didn&amp;rsquo;t encounter any homeless people either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city is mostly clean. People do not enter anyone&amp;rsquo;s house with their shoes on. There is almost zero vandalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;customer service&lt;/strong&gt; can not be imagined and replicated easily in other societies of the world. I know and have heard that people in India are very helpful. I felt people in Japan sometimes do &lt;em&gt;beyond normal&lt;/em&gt; things for their customers. People take their jobs very seriously. The entire bank staff greets you when you come in. You will not be left unattended even for a minute. And everyone will say Thank you and keep bowing until you get out of the door and disappear. My God, I used to feel bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The not-so-good things that I had heard are also true!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Language barrier&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get by in Tokyo if you don&amp;rsquo;t know Japanese and have friends whom you can talk to. But my life was of a &lt;em&gt;tourist&lt;/em&gt; and was limited in social terms. Essential shopping (groceries, etc.) becomes limited. I have to show an image and hope that the person can recognize what I am asking for. Using a public service e.g. Hospitals, courier service is hard. I can not enquire what I want to. Google Translate is barely helpful, and is useless most of the times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people learn Japanese after coming here. They see a life here and want to settle. As of now, I know I only want to &lt;em&gt;settle&lt;/em&gt; in India and maybe in an English speaking country. My work required no Japanese, hence I did not learn. Instead I invested my time in learning new paradigms of programming in a large company. I feel I made the right decision and learnt a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rush hour traffic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need courage to commute in the morning. Even if I wanted to start my day early, it is not going to happen. Trains are packed at more than 200% of their capacity between 7-9 AM. I won&amp;rsquo;t need to hold any bars in the moving trains because maybe five people would be pushing me from all directions. Lo and behold the laws of physics, I won&amp;rsquo;t fall or even move when the train accelerated. xD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;principles-of-work&#34;&gt;Principles of work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Things I learnt in my first job&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;living-asynchronously&#34;&gt;Living asynchronously&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three years ago, I read this blog post by Quincy Larson, the founder of freecodecamp.org, titled &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/live-asynchronously-c8e7172fe7ea/&#34;&gt;Live asynchronously.&lt;/a&gt;. I got inspired by it. I took the concepts of Promises and callbacks in Javascript on a philosophical level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working Synchronously is the easy option. Async is hard to code and to practice in real life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living async means writing neglibile number of messages/emails which require you to constantly wait until there is response. They block you from continuing to work on something else. Living async means lesser number of unimportant meetings and sync ups. In fact, when I used to be stuck in the beginning, I used to write my doubts as long expressive messages and would not expect a response immediately. I think I learnt this from the Open Source communities. ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;working-concurrently&#34;&gt;Working concurrently&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always took two or more concurrent (independent) tasks at the same time. If I get blocked or maybe bored with the first task, I would switch to the second one and would wait until I get unblocked. It is not feasible when the first task is huge. But even then, it can be broken down into chunks of concurrent pieces. And then, I would &amp;ldquo;parallelly process&amp;rdquo; them on my end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;writing-daily-notes&#34;&gt;Writing daily notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to take notes aggressively when I started working. I would write more than 100 words each day. I would publish them on an internal Confluence space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main reasons for doing this were -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We forget&lt;/strong&gt;. The meetings with our managers, mentors and coworkers in our first month are crucial. They convey some of the most important things about the company, team, project, etc. It was important for me to write &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of it down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self review&lt;/strong&gt;. At the end of the day, I would go through my notes and publish a summary of things I did, things I learnt, etc. It would take 10 minutes each day. My quarterly self reviews used to be very very long and exhaustive, since I had the logs of what I did. After six months, I changed the frequency of publishing the logs to weekly, but I would still take daily private notes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Being public&lt;/strong&gt;. My page was easily accessible by visiting &lt;code&gt;go/himanshu&lt;/code&gt; from inside the company. I loved that I was being transparent about how I am spending my time in the company. And it also helped my indirect co-workers to know what I do here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;docs-docs-code-docs-docs-technical-specs&#34;&gt;Docs, docs. code. docs. docs. Technical specs.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working on code without documentation is not fun. You are surprised each time you add a new feature. You have low confidence when making changes. For the love of humanity, document your decisions and the architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;integration-tests&#34;&gt;Integration tests&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unit tests are great. But I love end to end integration tests a lot. They give me more confidence that the functionality will not break with my PRs being merged. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist writing an integration test for the project I was working on. &lt;a href=&#34;https://natooktesting.wordpress.com/2017/08/24/x-unit-tests-0-integration-tests/&#34;&gt;You might have seen some gifs about X unit tests and 0 integration tests.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;no-unconstructive-criticism&#34;&gt;No unconstructive criticism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we join a new place, we notices hundreds of things that can be done better (according to us). If I go on complaining about all, and do not offer to fix any, I am being unhelpful. So, I did not offer any unnessary feedback or criticism unless they were constructive.
This is the Chapter 1 of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Win_Friends_and_Influence_People&#34;&gt;How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;scoping-a-project-breaking-down-into-smaller-tasks&#34;&gt;Scoping a project, breaking down into smaller tasks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good engineer is supposed to see the bigger picture of a project. They collaborate hand in hand with Product managers and help in writing the Spec. They break the project into smaller tasks which help them correctly estimate the timeline. They offer creative solutions which the PM might not be aware of.
This skill comes with experience and time spent in the company and is valued by everyone around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;next-steps-with-spotify&#34;&gt;Next steps with Spotify&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a few months, I will relocate to Stockholm, Sweden. Hopefully, the travel is permitted by then. My work will be related to Spotify&amp;rsquo;s newly open sourced project called &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/spotify/backstage&#34;&gt;Backstage&lt;/a&gt;. Spotify has been developing this for four years and has now decided to open source it, to simplify the infrastructure complexity in companies. Check it out, you&amp;rsquo;ll find it interesting. &lt;a href=&#34;https://backstage.io/&#34;&gt;backstage.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am personally very excited that I will get to work closely with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/decause/&#34;&gt;Remy Decausemaker&lt;/a&gt; again. Remy was my direct manager at Twitter. He now leads the Open Source program at Spotify. I have learnt so much about Open Source in the time that I have worked with him and I feel blessed that there lies more. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I know from Spotify engineering blogs and the people, it has a strong engineering culture. Teams (Squads) have autonomy of the work they do. People share knowledge and support collaboration and individual growth. I intend to stay in the company for long and hopefully I come out as a much better engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, Spotify is a product that I have been using for many years. It has helped me find artists who have touched my soul. I am very excited about what lies ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PEP8Speaks - Now helping 5,000 open source projects write neat and clean Python</title>
      <link>https://orkohunter.net/blog/pep8speaks-5000-projects/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 05 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://orkohunter.net/blog/pep8speaks-5000-projects/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-is-this-project-&#34;&gt;What is this project? 🐍&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PEP8Speaks = &lt;a href=&#34;https://pep8.org&#34;&gt;PEP 8&lt;/a&gt; + Speaks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GitHub: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/OrkoHunter/pep8speaks&#34;&gt;https://github.com/OrkoHunter/pep8speaks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PEP 8 is Python&amp;rsquo;s recommended coding style convention, popular across software written in Python language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PEP8Speaks is a GitHub app which reviews the Python code style in Pull Requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;how-did-it-start-&#34;&gt;How did it start? 📜&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My primary motivation to create this project was to reduce the workload of code maintainers and reviewers in Open Source.&lt;/strong&gt;
They spend a valuable amount of time doing code reviews. Checking and fixing code style is something that can be automated.
Hence, it must be!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made the first commit in December 2016. I was in my third year of college. In my first two summer breaks,
I had been contributing to Open Source projects in Python,
mainly because of the Google Summer of Code program. And in a few months, I was about to be a GSoC mentor,
which meant doing code reviews.
PEP8Speaks came alive out of my personal need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;users-and-adoption-&#34;&gt;Users and adoption 📈&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating and maintaining the project was not the hardest part. After the initial few months, I rant out of all my ideas.
So, the development slowed down. Hence I wanted other projects to start using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More users meant a lot of things.
I got to work on new features, optimizations, security, etc. Being very young in my career, meant
this was a wonderful way to do Software development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PEP8Speaks is useful for an open source project which has many contributors i.e. organizations&lt;/strong&gt;.
It is not very helpful if you are the only
one working on your project. Hence most of the time, if someone finds it useful, they have to convince all the maintainers
in their organization to start using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larger orgs are more hesitant in adding new things as a requirement or dependency because they are worried that it
would not work properly.
Hence, I needed to &lt;strong&gt;build trust in the project&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;growth-efforts&#34;&gt;Growth efforts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, organic growth requires me to do the following -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Being open for feature requests.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many cool features in PEP8Speaks are not my original ideas, but recommendations from the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers rarely want
to change the way they work. Instead, they love bending (customizing) the tools they use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If only PEP8Speaks were to support this new feature A,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;if only PEP8Speaks supported this feature B,&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&amp;hellip;we would love to adopt it!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implementing feature requests.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way of gaining trust in the community is to listen to the issues and incoming Pull Requests. These users helped
a lot in spreading the word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, I need to address all the feature requests.
But it is also limited by the time I have. So, I need to pick among those requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Having a helpful README&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every knowledge required to install and customize PEP8Speaks has to be on the README. And also, in a visually discoverable way.
Having a &lt;em&gt;kickass&lt;/em&gt; README is a must.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spreading the word at the right places&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tcJi378B2M&#34;&gt;a speaker at the SciPy 2017 conference&lt;/a&gt; in Austin.
In the lightning talks session, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtgiYrf2bv8&#34;&gt;I talked about PEP8Speaks&lt;/a&gt;.
The ballroom had close to a thousand Python developers. (SciPy conference is a yearly &amp;ldquo;pilgrimage&amp;rdquo; in the Scientific Python world.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is the reason, a lot of PEP8Speaks users include scientific Python projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PEP8Speaks bot has commented on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/search?o=desc&amp;amp;q=commenter%3Apep8speaks&amp;amp;s=&amp;amp;type=Issues&#34;&gt;around 17,000 pull requests&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GitHub API allows me to find out all the users of the project.
I keep the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/OrkoHunter/pep8speaks/wiki/List-of-users-and-orgs&#34;&gt;list of all organizations and users&lt;/a&gt; on the public wiki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;sponsorship-&#34;&gt;Sponsorship 💳&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the project is a free and open source software, it needs to be hosted on a server to work. The server receives around 3,000 API requests per minute.
I deployed it on Heroku because it was free of cost.
Heroku gave a limited number of hours per month for the servers to run. Within 1 year, the app started exhausting all the hours
very quickly. And then I had to pay for the server costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March 2019, I wrote a case to receive funding for the project. &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/OrkoHunter/pep8speaks/wiki/Funding&#34;&gt;https://github.com/OrkoHunter/pep8speaks/wiki/Funding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/OrkoHunter/pep8speaks/wiki/PSF-Grant-application&#34;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; to the PSF for the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.python.org/psf/grants/&#34;&gt;Python Software Foundation grant&lt;/a&gt;. They agreed to cover one year of server costs. 🎉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project also received funding from &lt;a href=&#34;https://weblate.org&#34;&gt;Weblate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://ccextractor.org/&#34;&gt;CCExtractor&lt;/a&gt;, which is amazing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;future-of-the-project-&#34;&gt;Future of the project ⏳&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project does not have many bugs, but I do receive one or two issues in the repository per month. I have a local setup with
few Jupyter Notebooks where I
do the debugging and I fix the problem for them. My main concern is that debugging PEP8Speaks is not straightforward.
I want to make the development process smooth. This means the project can be maintained by more people, not one person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PEP8Speaks can be installed on public repositories with a few clicks, but running on private repositories is not trivial.
I have written the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/OrkoHunter/pep8speaks/wiki/Instructions-to-deploy-a-fork&#34;&gt;instructions to do it&lt;/a&gt;.
There are currently &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/search?q=pep8speaks&amp;amp;type=Users&#34;&gt;9 private forks&lt;/a&gt; of PEP8Speaks, that I know of.
But, I want to make it easier for private repositories to start using it. Just like
running CircleCI or Codecov on private repos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last most important thing in my mind is to improve the infrastructure. Write more developer-focused documentation, technical spec
of the project and support new contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>BFS vs DFS in friendships</title>
      <link>https://orkohunter.net/blog/bfs-vs-dfs-in-friendships/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 09 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://orkohunter.net/blog/bfs-vs-dfs-in-friendships/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you already know and remember what &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search&#34;&gt;Breadth First Search (BFS)&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search&#34;&gt;Depth First Search (DFS)&lt;/a&gt; are, skip to &lt;strong&gt;What are you saying?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take my words with a grain of salt. I am mostly writing metaphors here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;quick-intro-to-bfs-and-dfs&#34;&gt;Quick intro to BFS and DFS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Graph Theory, we perform a search by traversing the graph. We start with one node and traverse the entire graph until we find what we are looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to do that, but the two most popular ones are &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search&#34;&gt;Breadth First Search (BFS)&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search&#34;&gt;Depth First Search (DFS)&lt;/a&gt;. The name of the method is key to what do they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In BFS, we search all the neighbour nodes first. And then search the 2nd-degree neighbours, then 3rd-degree, and so on. Here is a neat animation from Wikipedia for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/Animated_BFS.gif&#34; alt=&#34;BFS GIF&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in DFS, we start with a neighbour and keep going in its branch as deep as we can, and then backtrack to a second neighbour and go deep into its branch, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read the wikipedia articles if you want to know more. &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search&#34;&gt;BFS&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search&#34;&gt;DFS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-are-you-saying&#34;&gt;What are you saying?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BFS and DFS can be seen among people as traits of how they make friends. Like introversion and extroversion, BFS and DFS are the characteristics of people&amp;rsquo;s approach to &lt;em&gt;friendship&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You might already have some idea by now. Take few seconds and draw a picture. Imagine two people (one doing BFS and other doing DFS)
and think how they are different. It is fun to observe and ponder. :)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;College campus life is a perfect setting to spot both kinds of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-are-they-different&#34;&gt;How are they different?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A person who is on the extreme end with &lt;strong&gt;BFS&lt;/strong&gt; would generally have a larger number of friends and smaller number of acquaintances.
They constantly seek to convert their acquaintances into friends. They do not have any hard time making friends with someone.
They have a fear of missing out on creating new friendships as time slips by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A person who is on the other extreme with &lt;strong&gt;DFS&lt;/strong&gt; would have a significant number of acquaintances but a smaller number of friends.
They would always be interested in taking their friendships on to the next level. They are NOT afraid of missing out on new friendships
and want to work a lot on the existing ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BFS&lt;/strong&gt; people can generate the same intensity in new friendships, as with their existing friends. They don&amp;rsquo;t need much time for this.
Yet, most of the time BFS people are afraid to go deep into conversations with one friend. They would stop at one point.
They would fall out of conversations pretty easily. They wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be interested in knowing more about their friends.
They would be certain they know enough about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DFS&lt;/strong&gt; people never get bored with the friends they hangout with. They are willing to share deepest level of spiritual secrets
with each other. It takes a significant amount of time for their newer friendships to reach the intensity of their existing
friendships. They have strong perceptions, but loosely-held. They would cheer to look at things from other people&amp;rsquo;s perceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Let me know if you can think of more differences.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;final-words&#34;&gt;Final words&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone has to do BFS first. In first year of college, you don&amp;rsquo;t have enough nodes to do DFS with. So, you spend the first
(and maybe second) year doing BFS. You join clubs, you hangout with your hostel-mates, and neighbours to create
&lt;a href=&#34;https://orkohunter.net/blog/threads/&#34;&gt;threads&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this, if you are a DFS person, your DFS mode will trigger. And it never stops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not have a dichotomous view on which is the right way of living. I believe one has to find the right balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://nishnik.me&#34;&gt;Nishant Nikhil&lt;/a&gt; for bringing this up, one fine evening back in college.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Peeking over what people search on DC</title>
      <link>https://orkohunter.net/blog/peeking-over-dc-search/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 18 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://orkohunter.net/blog/peeking-over-dc-search/</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IS THIS EVEN POSSIBLE?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BUT YOU PROBABLY NEED TO BE A DC ADMIN TO GET THIS, NO?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nope. Anyone can do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holy Schnikes!!!! TELL ME HOW TO DO IT ON DC++!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lol, come to Linux already!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: I shall not be giving out a one-click solution to monitor DC searches intentionally even if it were possible. But if you are dedicated enough, you can figure things out by reading it. Also, I’m not the first person to know about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_Connect_%28protocol%29&#34;&gt;What is DC?&lt;/a&gt; It’s a peer-to-peer file sharing protocol. Computers connected with each other can share files among them, and if you are on LAN, you get them on a terrific speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GET TO THE POINT!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, alright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;theory&#34;&gt;Theory&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say Mr X and I are connected to a DC hub. Let’s say it happens that both of us are online at the same time. Mr X searched for &lt;code&gt;New movies&lt;/code&gt; in their favorite DC client e.g. DC++, LinuxDC++, etc. Their client sends this request to the hub we both are connected, to fetch a search result. The hub then forwards the request to &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; who is connected to it and returns the index for Mr X to click and download any file from anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SO GIVE ME THE SCRIPT. OR DO YOU HAVE THE CODE OR A REPOSITORY?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There isn’t really a script or any code. :/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;exploit&#34;&gt;Exploit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the theory, we can sit back, stay connected to the hub and receive a holy large amount of data like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who joined/left the hub when, their nick and their IP address&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are people searching for and IP address associated with each query&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are in KGP, you can &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.metakgp.org/w/IP_allocation&#34;&gt;trace back the IP addresses to even room numbers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;technology&#34;&gt;Technology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normal DC clients won’t allow us to see these requests. There is a client known as &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.yorhel.nl/ncdc&#34;&gt;ncdc&lt;/a&gt; (distributed as a binary) which doesn’t really have a GUI, so you can run it on a terminal (Aah, the feels it gives!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use ncdc to connect to the hub&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable logging to a file and set &lt;code&gt;log_debug&lt;/code&gt; to True&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: This will generate a lot of data if you’re connected to a large hub and thus make sure you keep clearing the log file&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;tail -f /path/to/logfile&lt;/code&gt; to see the queries sent by DC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parse the queries and tada!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protip: You can feed &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana&#34;&gt;Kibana&lt;/a&gt; the data and visualize them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You probably will have to set some config in ncdc to change from Passive mode to Active mode or else, some hubs mights ban you. Google properly, read the ncdc documentation and you’ll be fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EDIT: &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@icyflame&#34;&gt;Siddharth Kannan&lt;/a&gt; used tcpdump to capture the TCP/IP packets which contains the DC query strings as well. Check out the 107,000 search results he accumulated in a week over here stored as &lt;code&gt;all_packet_info.json&lt;/code&gt;. This is the code he used&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo tcpdump -b -t src 10.109.xx.xx -w incoming-search-`date +%s`.pcap -c 1000;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;live-streaming&#34;&gt;Live Streaming&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hard. But if you really want to live stream the searches and that to be accessible outside of the campus network, there is a hack. You can have a server hosted somewhere outside the network which is going to stream data to the public. Share the URL of this server to people you want to. Create an endpoint over here which can receive data through POST request. Now, use your laptop from inside the network to constantly send requests on to the server. Make sure to use authentication by headers to avoid exploitation!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/OrkoHunter/dc-audio/&#34;&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; leftover &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/OrkoHunter/dctrends&#34;&gt;code&lt;/a&gt; if you can find use of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you have this, here’s something you need to remember: Don’t be dick. That’s all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Hacking! ✨&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>#DeleteFacebook</title>
      <link>https://orkohunter.net/blog/delete-facebook/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 25 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://orkohunter.net/blog/delete-facebook/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://orkohunter.net/img/1*0l-9QfuqEhDiBumKeTmGuQ.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After letting Facebook Inc. build a vast profile of me for 9 years, I deleted my facebook account. Privacy is not my &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; concern, but I &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@OrkoHunter/the-discovery-of-pseudo-acquaintance-9f903601d916&#34;&gt;personally reacted&lt;/a&gt; to how Facebook has affected &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/20/16800842/facebook-2017-russia-scandal-news-feed-criticism-defectors&#34;&gt;the way we interact in our real life&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how&#34;&gt;How?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Downloaded a copy of my data from facebook -&amp;gt; settings
This contained all of my messages, photos, videos, and probably a lot more information which I can not consciously recall sharing with Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Created a dummy facebook account* and added it to the resourceful groups I might miss out important information from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*An account without any interaction i.e. No likes, No reactions neither love nor angry, no comments, no photos/videos, no “friends”. A profile to just receive information on email (sent by facebook).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/help/delete_account&#34;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/help/delete_account&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Going extreme) Blocked Facebook servers on my computer that my computer can never communicate to domain names linked to Facebook servers. See &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jmdugan/blocklists/tree/master/corporations/facebook&#34;&gt;the list&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;why&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;social-concerns&#34;&gt;Social concerns&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People started using Facebook as LinkedIn by adding Freinds and it blurred the lines of relationships between two individuals — &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@OrkoHunter/the-discovery-of-pseudo-acquaintance-9f903601d916&#34;&gt;Article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Real addiction to unreal things — &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/3ev7GXzFTPg?t=3m10s&#34;&gt;Video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook (read &lt;em&gt;Social Media&lt;/em&gt;) promotes Ignorance by thoughtless comments, replies and reactions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;privacy-concerns&#34;&gt;Privacy concerns&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This will suffice — &lt;a href=&#34;https://stallman.org/facebook.html&#34;&gt;https://stallman.org/facebook.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Design of Public Posts: Twitter vs Facebook</title>
      <link>https://orkohunter.net/blog/twitter-vs-facebook/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://orkohunter.net/blog/twitter-vs-facebook/</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What design tells you about the company’s values&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Facebook and Twitter allow posts to be publicly accessible by people who have not joined the platform. It is good to note that the default setting of Facebook is to be private with posts and Twitter to be open to the web. While managing the Facebook and Twitter account of an organization I am involved in, I noticed a serious design pattern involved in displaying the public posts and their stark differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;case-1-stages-of-interacting-withtwitter&#34;&gt;Case 1: Stages of interacting with Twitter&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you open a &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/kossiitkgp/status/954776125573554176&#34;&gt;public tweet&lt;/a&gt; in incognito mode, or while being logged out, you’ll land on something like this —&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://orkohunter.net/img/1*jYcPCOlsEVbI7WL7oEhE9A.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 1&lt;/strong&gt; of interaction consists of the &lt;em&gt;content of the tweet&lt;/em&gt; with the highest visibility, followed by who created the tweet, then more details about the tweet. At this point of time, there is no available “Sign Up” button to be clicked. You can now easily close the tab since most of the times, your purpose would be the information contained in the tweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you feel engaged and you click on the close button on the top right corner, you’ll land on the profile page of the account which created the tweet, which I call the &lt;strong&gt;Stage 2.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://orkohunter.net/img/1*fgnX8sn_C3B7RBuzTF614g.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see that the majority percentage of the web page is covered with the profile information. On the sidebar and header, there are interactive elements which lead you to sign up on the platform. And you would do, if you seem impressed. Let’s have a look at Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case 2: Stages of interacting with a public post on Facebook&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you open a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/kossiitkgp/photos/a.551030724973932.1073741826.524856034258068/1588200897923571/&#34;&gt;public post&lt;/a&gt; on Facebook, you land on something like this —&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://orkohunter.net/img/1*-sIjEoUp6WckYnrziAf_KQ.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s interesting to notice that much more than half of the area is covered with &lt;strong&gt;ways to either join or log in to Facebook&lt;/strong&gt;. And the Stage 1 has &lt;em&gt;zero&lt;/em&gt; information about the post (which was the sole purpose of opening that particular URL). The only way to close this banner is to find that tiny &lt;em&gt;Not Now&lt;/em&gt; text below the big Green &lt;em&gt;Create New Account&lt;/em&gt;. An interesting design flaw (whether intentional or by mistake) is that the typography of &lt;em&gt;Not Now&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Forgotten Account?&lt;/em&gt; is exactly the same, even when the later button is clicked once a hundred times and the former 99 out of 100 times. I think it’s intentional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s click on &lt;em&gt;Not Now&lt;/em&gt;, and move the &lt;strong&gt;Stage 2&lt;/strong&gt; of the view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://orkohunter.net/img/1*DjkjiZQ7_yC_IADORFLO_Q.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this webpage, the area covered with the information about the post is still comparable or maybe less than the &lt;em&gt;engageble area of log in and sign up&lt;/em&gt;. It’s funny to note that there are &lt;strong&gt;five&lt;/strong&gt; interactive buttons on this single web page to Join Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;conclusions&#34;&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Facebook’s main focus is on targeting as many people as they can, while Twitter’s main focus does not &lt;em&gt;appear&lt;/em&gt; so. Even if both the products want users, Facebook is &lt;strong&gt;desperately user-hungry&lt;/strong&gt; in public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Content is not respected on Facebook while Twitter values the content over anything else. Eventually content dies out on Facebook while people keep retweeting and referring 5 year old tweets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thank you for reading. This post is up for suggestions and discussions!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren&#39;t special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you&#39;re Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it&#39;s a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let&#39;s do more of those!

&lt;p&gt;The Zen of Python was introduced in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/#id2&#34;&gt;PEP 20&lt;/a&gt;. It is supposed to be 20 aphorisms, but only 19 of which have been written down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The code for the Zen violates itself. It&amp;rsquo;s not beautiful but ugly, not explicit but implicit.
This would probably be the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; module to go against the spirit of what it says itself.

&lt;li&gt;Each and every line is the philosophy of Python&amp;rsquo;s design and is a supreme holy guide&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe just to show that there always should be a new line at the end of a file!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not an easter egg, a joke in the interpreter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It opens this &lt;a href=&#34;https://xkcd.com/353&#34;&gt;xkcd comic&lt;/a&gt; which demonstrates how easy it is to do stuff with modules&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is to instantly close down any conversation about introducing curly braces to Python&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Guido van Rossum is a big fan of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python%27s_Flying_Circus&#34;&gt;Monty Python&amp;rsquo;s Flying Circus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a substitution cipher called &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13&#34;&gt;ROT13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In many languages there are two ways to do the same thing &lt;code&gt;--no&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;no--&lt;/code&gt;. The message has a hidden example in itself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support for unicode character set for naming identifiers was added in Python3. Though, it is not explicitly preferred while writing code, it adds flavour to working with scientific formulas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The original code is &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Lib/antigravity.py&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://xkcd.com/426/&#34;&gt;xkcd comic&lt;/a&gt; referenced, and maybe that&amp;rsquo;s why this is also in the &lt;code&gt;antigravity&lt;/code&gt; module&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0401/&#34;&gt;PEP 401&lt;/a&gt; is an April Fools&amp;rsquo; Joke - The PEP&amp;rsquo;s number is 401, i.e. 4/01 or April 1st (April Fools&amp;rsquo; Day). The PEP states that Guido van Rossum is stepping down. The new title given to him would be pronounced &amp;ldquo;BDEVIL&amp;rdquo; (Benevolent Dictator Emeritus Vacationing Indefinitely from the Language) and Guido&amp;rsquo;s successor will be Barry Warsaw, or as he is affectionately known, Uncle Barry. Uncle Barry&amp;rsquo;s official title is &amp;ldquo;FLUFL&amp;rdquo; (Friendly Language Uncle For Life). There are in-jokes about the Parrot virtual machine and the &amp;ldquo;non-existent&amp;rdquo; Python Secret Underground (possibly a throw-back to &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_Is_No_Cabal&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;TINC&amp;rdquo; on USENET&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Lessons for creating good open source software</title>
      <link>https://orkohunter.net/blog/lessons-open-source/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 20 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://orkohunter.net/blog/lessons-open-source/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://orkohunter.net/img/1*YNBTPaCNBNWLoT7XAbJ1Lw.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was reading about &lt;em&gt;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&lt;/em&gt;, a book by &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_S._Raymond&#34;&gt;Eric S. Raymond&lt;/a&gt; on various (open source) software development methods. The wikipedia page for the book in short, lists few important lessons that he learned and they can not be more true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer’s personal itch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to rewrite (and reuse).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plan to throw one [version] away; you will, anyhow. (Copied from Frederick Brooks’ &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_S._Raymond&#34;&gt;The Mythical Man-Month&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have the right attitude, interesting problems will find you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you lose interest in a program, your last duty to it is to hand it off to a competent successor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treating your users as co-developers is your least-hassle route to rapid code improvement and effective debugging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Release_early,_release_often&#34;&gt;Release early. Release often.&lt;/a&gt; And listen to your customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smart data structures and dumb code works a lot better than the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you treat your beta-testers as if they’re your most valuable resource, they will respond by becoming your most valuable resource.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next best thing to having good ideas is recognizing good ideas from your users. Sometimes the latter is better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often, the most striking and innovative solutions come from realizing that your concept of the problem was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perfection (in design) is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but rather when there is nothing more to take away. (Attributed to &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_de_Saint-Exup%C3%A9ry&#34;&gt;Antoine de Saint-Exupéry&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any tool should be useful in the expected way, but a truly great tool lends itself to uses you never expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When writing gateway software of any kind, take pains to disturb the data stream as little as possible — and never throw away information unless the recipient forces you to!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When your language is nowhere near Turing-complete, syntactic sugar can be your friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A security system is only as secure as its secret. Beware of pseudo-secrets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To solve an interesting problem, start by finding a problem that is interesting to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Provided the development coordinator has a communications medium at least as good as the Internet, and knows how to lead without coercion, many heads are inevitably better than one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar#Lessons_for_creating_good_open_source_software&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Attribution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These lessons are really something to be read periodically while developing and contributing to open source software. They are worth noting down and sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Keep : A personal shell command keeper</title>
      <link>https://orkohunter.net/blog/keep/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 23 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://orkohunter.net/blog/keep/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-meta-clitoolkit&#34;&gt;A Meta CLI toolkit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writwick Wraj loves using the command line.
Writwick googles “How to do X in terminal?” and multiple forums and blog posts finally provide him the magical &lt;em&gt;command&lt;/em&gt; for the rescue. Problem Solved !
Fast forward couple weeks, Writwick has to do X in terminal, again. Wraj remembers solving this few weeks ago. Let him do a reverse-i-search with &lt;em&gt;Ctrl+R&lt;/em&gt;. Nope, can’t remember sh*t. Browser search history? 25 web pages found matching *X*. Argh!
Writwik finally finds the solution. From this time Writwik starts writing the commands somewhere online for the future.
Wait, why shouldn’t he keep the command in his terminal itself if this is only place where he’ll ever have use it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://orkohunter.net/img/1*A4bHZhazEzT2giYA-djLmA.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introducing a new command line tool which solves the issue of memorizing commands or storing them somewhere which is difficult to find. With the grep and run commands, one can easily find their long forgotten commands and use them them right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;keep-is-distributed-across-all-your-computers&#34;&gt;Keep is distributed across all your computers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If not already, use keep register to create a database of your commands on the Keep remote. You can push and pull the commands from any of your computers. This comes handy when we are in our ssh sessions, and all we’ve got at our disposal, is a shell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;keep-is-open-source&#34;&gt;Keep is Open Source ❤&lt;/h3&gt;

There are mainly three types of the quotations; literature, fortunes and riddles. I once tried adding fortune in my ~/.zshrc file so that a new fortune would appear whenever I create a new terminal session. There are many other places for making it appear e.g. Login, Logout, XScreenSaver, etc. However, I later went for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;fortune | cowsay -f tux
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;cowsay is another program which takes a string and displays in a balloon over acat figure. Note that both of them have to be installed (using apt-get).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll now be adding shell commands to generate the messages with random cowsay characters. &lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jackinloadup/732325/raw/422d2175d5561b8d47e19232696c9e043b7b4e37/generate-cowsay&#34;&gt;Courtesy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Quick guide to git and github (Part 1)</title>
      <link>https://orkohunter.net/blog/quick-guide-to-git-and-github-1/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 25 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://orkohunter.net/blog/quick-guide-to-git-and-github-1/</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we start, make sure you have an account on GitHub. Go to &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/&#34;&gt;https://github.com&lt;/a&gt;. Pick a username, enter your email id and choose a password. Next, choose &lt;em&gt;unlimited personal repositories for free&lt;/em&gt;. In the final step you can give some input to github and voila ! You are now a github user. (If you are redirect from KWoC, use the username there.) There is plethora of git guides over internet, some are really good and some really suck. I here am writing a simple blog for the newbies who have successfully made an account over github and are really excited about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GitHub&lt;/strong&gt; is a web-based Git repository hosting service, which offers some of the distributed revision control and source code management(SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. Unlike Git, which is strictly a command-line tool, GitHub provides a web-based graphical interface and desktop as well as mobile integration&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or simply&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Github connects you with other people who are interested in sharing and creating together.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there are really two ways to begin with. Here goes the first one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a repository : Repository is what you call the stuff you are going to upload and work on. Go to &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/new&#34;&gt;https://github.com/new&lt;/a&gt; and create a repository. Let’s name it hello-world. 
Add some description, or you might want to add it later. Initialize it with a Readme. It&amp;rsquo;s a good practice and let&amp;rsquo;s you clone it immediately. (Yeah right, see below)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clone it : Open your console, move to the directory where you want to work and do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ git clone https://github.com/username/hello-world.git
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will create a directory in your computer. Now, this isn’t a simple directory. It is a ‘clone’ of the github repository. You can say that the files in it are controlled by the version control system git and tracked with the repository on github. Note : If you have not installed git, see &lt;a href=&#34;https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do this,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ cd hello-world
$ git remote -v
origin https://github.com/&amp;lt;username&amp;gt;/hello-world.git (fetch)
origin https://github.com/&amp;lt;username&amp;gt;/hello-world.git (push)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;This shows that the link to repository of yours at github is known by the name origin over here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, you will have to configure your name and your email address which you will be using for making the commits (don’t worry about what it means right now, we will cover it soon). This configuring is ideally done only once in a lifetime of your system (or unless you purposely remove your ~/.gitconfig file but that’s the story of another time).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ git config --global user.name &amp;quot;ABC XYZ&amp;quot;
$ git config --global user.email &amp;quot;abc@xyz.com&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now another way of this is first you create the directory on your computer. Navigate inside it and do&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ git init
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will initialize an empty git repository inside it. Later, you can add the link to the repository by the git remote command like this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ git remote add origin https://github.com/&amp;lt;username&amp;gt;/hello-world
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can always use &lt;code&gt;git remote -v&lt;/code&gt; command to track the aliases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making the first change : Okay now we are in condition of adding some files or code to this repository. I am going to make a python file with hello world program and publish the change over the github repository too. 
So make a new file say hello.py inside the directory, open it with your favorite editor and write the one line code to print whatever you want. Why just hello world? (Because dmr did it!) Now write it and save the file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing you should always do is to see whether you have done any changes or not in the repository. This can be done by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ git status&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the changes you made, you must be getting this after git status&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;On branch master
 Your branch is up-to-date with &#39;origin/master&#39;.
 Untracked files:
 (use &amp;quot;git add &amp;lt;file&amp;gt;...&amp;quot; to include in what will be committed)
 hello.py
 nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use &amp;quot;git add&amp;quot; to track)Add, Commit, Push! : In your console, do this.

$ git add .
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;This adds all the files in the track which you have changed. 
Now it’s time to commit that change. By committing, git understands that you want the change to be in record. Every commit is accompanied with a message that appears on the log (git log). A commit should represent one logical change only which should be supported by a relevant commit message. The convention is to write the commit in the verbal form ie. tell the computer to do that for you. Do this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ git commit -m &amp;quot;add hello.py&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve made your first commit! But it won’t be appearing over github, because you made the changes locally. You need to push it over the web. For that, you use&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ git push&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ git push origin&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to say git where actually you are pushing it to. Or,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ git push origin master&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to say git over what branch on origin you are pushing it to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s it! You’ve published your changes to your GitHub repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE : This is a very basic start. There are more concepts to be explored. You can search for specifics. StackOverflow also has great resources. We’ll leave the nitty gritties of Git for another day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Coding!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Google Summer of Code 2016 Report : Stingray</title>
      <link>https://orkohunter.net/blog/gsoc2016-report/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 20 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://orkohunter.net/blog/gsoc2016-report/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It began 5 months ago, in February. Due to my recent interests in Image Processing, I had made &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3AOrkoHunter+is%3Aclosed&#34;&gt;few&lt;/a&gt; Pull Requests to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image&#34;&gt;scikit-image&lt;/a&gt; library, but it did not participate in GSoC. And that, after all those years of consecutive partcipation! (Yes I felt little sad.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the day when Google announced the list of organizations, I started my “org hunt” ! And by the end of the day, I had sorted out the Python-only projects, which included the project &lt;a href=&#34;http://timelabtechnologies.com/ideas.html&#34;&gt;Library of Time Series methods&lt;/a&gt;. The project was to make a library with methods useful to the research in X-ray astronomy. I was thrilled by the idea! Nevertheless, I was not much aware of the astronomical aspects of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In next 10–15 days, I submitted my proposal and few Pull Requests, among which I think &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray/pull/74&#34;&gt;refactoring the Lightcurve class&lt;/a&gt; helped me understand the core of the library. In the pre-GSoC period, I also contributed in establishing Continuous Integration with &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray/pull/51&#34;&gt;Travis&lt;/a&gt; for Unix and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray/pull/63&#34;&gt;Appveyor&lt;/a&gt; for Windows. Meanwhile, Stingray, the library we were working on, was re-designed to become an &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray/pull/52&#34;&gt;Astropy affiliated package&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the wee hours of April 23, the results were announced and I &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5755858201870336&#34;&gt;selected&lt;/a&gt;! My primary and helping mentors were &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dhuppenkothen&#34;&gt;Daniela Huppenkothen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/matteobachetti&#34;&gt;Matteo Bachetti&lt;/a&gt;, both from different time zones, which really helped me in getting my answers as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first ten days of the Community Bonding period, my end semester exams were going on. The main medium of the communication between my mentors and me was Slack. And I must say, we totally loved it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started off with implementing &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-spectrum&#34;&gt;Cross Spectra&lt;/a&gt;, basing to a lot of work that was previously done by &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/abigailStev&#34;&gt;Abigail Stevens&lt;/a&gt;. Later on, Coherence and Lags were added in the Crossspectrum class, along with their tests and docstring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the mid-terms the major work was to add the Covariance spectra, and its “Averaged” counter part as well, along with errors for both. My final PR was to add the simple matrix of Dynamical Powerspectrum, which is open as of now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout this period, I was able to open &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3AOrkoHunter+is%3Aclosed&#34;&gt;22 Pull requests&lt;/a&gt; and push &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray/commits/master?author=OrkoHunter&#34;&gt;116 commits&lt;/a&gt; to the main repository &lt;em&gt;i.e.&lt;/em&gt; StingraySoftware/Stingray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that I would like to share, of many things which I learnt in this perioid, is that numpy booleans are little tricky. For e.g.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;In []: np.isfinite(100) is True
Out[]: False
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is because np.isfinite or similar functions do not return the basic Python bool but an instance of numpy bool. And in the __eq__ magic method of the numpy bool class, it is evaluated to the Python booleans. And so, &lt;code&gt;np.isfinite(100) == True&lt;/code&gt; would return True.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is all for now. It was a great experience for me, and I am very thankful to Daniela, Matteo and Abigail for all the help during the summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Losing and Re-Gaining trust on .gitignore</title>
      <link>https://orkohunter.net/blog/losing-and-regaining-truct-on-gitignore/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 20 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://orkohunter.net/blog/losing-and-regaining-truct-on-gitignore/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I would like to share an interesting story of a problem which I’ve faced many times since I started using git. This story is about “losing and re-gaining trust on .gitignore”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Event :&lt;/strong&gt; Create a Python app. Run it, test it and Boom! Now it’s time to push it to GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git init .
git remote add https://github.com/iamsosmart/notsomuch.git
git push -u origin master
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shit, Shit, Shit ! I wasn’t supposed to push the pyc&lt;/em&gt; files. Oh this looks so lame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re amateur enough, not to feel uncomfortable after pushing those files, you’re golden. Else, you’ll think of something called .gitignore which helps in ignoring unwanted files to be added in your git repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll then search for a good gitignore file for Python and Google will give you exactly what you want, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Python.gitignore&#34;&gt;Python.gitignore&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;wget -O .gitignore https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/master/Python.gitignore
git add -A
git commit -m &amp;quot;Added .gitignore file&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, you’ll try to remove the pyc files, using rm -rf *.pyc. But as soon as you&amp;rsquo;ll do this, (and if you&amp;rsquo;re using oh-my-zsh), you&amp;rsquo;ll see a cross on your prompt. That means, git has &lt;em&gt;detected&lt;/em&gt; a change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But wait? Why is git detecting changes to pyc files, when I’ve already added the gitignore!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if you’re me, you’ll feel betrayed by git. You’ll make a few calls and send messages to people, and say &lt;em&gt;“gitignore is not obeying me”&lt;/em&gt;, and they’ll hang up on you, saying &lt;em&gt;“it must be your fault”&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believe me, even the “future me” would have said the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the problem is that once you have staged a file, gitignore won’t have anything to do with it. So, if you’ll remove the staged file (pyc files, in this case), git will say to you that you’ve deleted them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later on, I googled the string “gitignore not working” and O thanks to stackoverflow, I was rescued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After adding the .gitignore, simply do this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git rm -rf --cached .
git add .
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or, instead of &lt;code&gt;rm -rf *.pyc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;, I must have done&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;git rm -rf *.pyc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ta-da ! And that’s when, my friends, the trust I have in git’s simplicity increased by a tini-tiny bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a python script is compiled, it generates compiled code as pyc files, also called byte code.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What do I do when I’m bored from studying (or not studying) for the exams?</title>
      <link>https://orkohunter.net/blog/ping-me-and-keep/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 20 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://orkohunter.net/blog/ping-me-and-keep/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The semester is about to end and I have no clue about what is going in the end semester examinations. I have been studying a good amount of complicated Mathematics. I usually lose my temper studying my other subjects like Environmental Science, Biology and Economics. For how long will I have to study “everything”. Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I either eat or surf the web when I’m not studying. That’s pretty much it. I received an email from the Central Library of my college that a book which I had issued very long time ago (and never read, of course) has been over due and I will have to pay fine in case of further delay. Aargh! I had to do it first thing in the morning! I was wired into my laptop. I didn’t want to get up and set the alarm in my phone or even on Google now. I wanted it right from my terminal. I wasted another half an hour finding such a thing but couldn’t find the one I was exactly looking for. (Duh! I could have set the alarm by then.). So, after some research and a lot of motivation, I created a repository on github and started my work. I had no idea how was I going to tackle command line executions, Natural Language Processing or anything but I had to make one thing possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ ping-me to go to library tomorrow morning
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;This one line terminal (english?) command should set the reminder for me on all of my personal devices. Peace! :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve shared the code here — &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/OrkoHunter/ping-me&#34;&gt;https://github.com/OrkoHunter/ping-me&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven’t written the engine write now. I have bookmarked a lot a sites related to NLP. I’ll continue with them in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My second toy project in the meantime came out to be &lt;code&gt;keep&lt;/code&gt;. I usually don’t remember shell commands but I need them the most in ssh sessions. I’m also sick of googling for the same code everytime, I needed to store them somewhere in the computer, using the terminal only…And Ta-da! It’s working! &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/OrkoHunter/keep&#34;&gt;https://github.com/OrkoHunter/keep&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and yes, I used python for all of the things above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Coding !&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why is Sublime Text not something to be frowned upon?</title>
      <link>https://orkohunter.net/blog/sublime-text/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 20 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://orkohunter.net/blog/sublime-text/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There have been people, advisers, and more people, enlightening the fact about “real programmers”, &lt;em&gt;they use emacs or vim&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘I use sublime text’&lt;/em&gt;, is often misunderstood as &lt;em&gt;‘I am a novice and I don’t like pure black window’.&lt;/em&gt; There is no way this 7 years old editor is going to compete with 39 years old emacs and 15 years old fork of yet another 39 years old editor vi. Nevertheless, there’s much more to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing that Sublime Text lovers say about vim and emacs is &lt;em&gt;“Why should I open an editor which I don’t know how to get out of?”&lt;/em&gt; Fair enough. They are not mere text editors. They have built-in code to edit any external code. Isn’t that pretty? Well, you have to follow some steps to close it. (Or you can forcefully shut down your console anytime you want. No matter they are powerful, you belong to the human race.) They also have more powerful features which make its user’s life easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before you’ll think of your easy life, they’ll make you hate your life first. As &lt;a href=&#34;https://pascalprecht.github.io/&#34;&gt;Pascal Precht&lt;/a&gt; in one of his blogs discuss about the learning curve wall of vim. Here is a picture which is very explanatory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://orkohunter.net/img/0*kB_zwuOIp-vb2SRy.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;The next argument by emacs users are &lt;em&gt;“We don’t like using touchpad and want everything right there in our editor, like mail, news, everything!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are great sir! But let me also tell you, you are rare and have wrong conclusion about sublime users. We aren’t fond of touchpad either! As of me, I survived a whole semester of college with &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.orkohunter.net/touchpad-problem-with-asus-laptop-on-linux/&#34;&gt;my touchpad not working&lt;/a&gt;. But that doesn’t mean I moved to emacs or vim. subl to open, pgup pgdn and arrow keys for navigation, ctrl + s to save, ctrl + t for new tab, I mean I had got everything done with my keyboard and the fact is that Chrome also obeys these commands (or vice-versa). Imagine you scrolling through a webpage and wondering why j and k are not helping you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point I’m trying to make is why shouldn’t we encourage newbies to use the editor which makes their life really easy very fast so that they could simply learn how to code rather then learning how to code to code. Later on, let them decide whether they really dislike this editor and move on to something more challenging and I believe some people will surely move on to the challenging ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I will surely not. I’ll wait for the day when I’ll get tired of putting my hands on something so beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
