After letting Facebook Inc. build a vast profile of me for 9 years, I deleted my facebook account. Privacy is not my _only_ concern, but I [personally reacted](https://medium.com/@OrkoHunter/the-discovery-of-pseudo-acquaintance-9f903601d916) to how Facebook has affected [the way we interact in our real life](https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/20/16800842/facebook-2017-russia-scandal-news-feed-criticism-defectors).

### How?

1. Downloaded a copy of my data from facebook -> settings
   This contained all of my messages, photos, videos, and probably a lot more information which I can not consciously recall sharing with Facebook.

2. Created a dummy facebook account\* and added it to the resourceful groups I might miss out important information from.

_\*An account without any interaction i.e. No likes, No reactions neither love nor angry, no comments, no photos/videos, no “friends”. A profile to just receive information on email (sent by facebook)._

3. [https://www.facebook.com/help/delete_account](https://www.facebook.com/help/delete_account)

4. (Going extreme) Blocked Facebook servers on my computer that my computer can never communicate to domain names linked to Facebook servers. See [the list](https://github.com/jmdugan/blocklists/tree/master/corporations/facebook).

### **Why?**

#### Social concerns

- People started using Facebook as LinkedIn by adding Freinds and it blurred the lines of relationships between two individuals — [Article](https://medium.com/@OrkoHunter/the-discovery-of-pseudo-acquaintance-9f903601d916)
- Real addiction to unreal things — [Video](https://youtu.be/3ev7GXzFTPg?t=3m10s)
- Facebook (read _Social Media_) promotes Ignorance by thoughtless comments, replies and reactions

#### Privacy concerns

- This will suffice — <https://stallman.org/facebook.html>
