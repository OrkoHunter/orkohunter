## fortune | cowsay

![](./fortune.png)

> This is about how I maintain the space <https://github.com/OrkoHunter/mfdf/blob/master/fortunes>fortune is a Unix program which chooses a random message from its database of quotations and displays in the Shell. There are mainly three types of the quotations; literature, fortunes and riddles. I once tried adding fortune in my ~/.zshrc file so that a new fortune would appear whenever I create a new terminal session. There are many other places for making it appear e.g. Login, Logout, XScreenSaver, etc. However, I later went for

```
fortune | cowsay -f tux
```

cowsay is another program which takes a string and displays in a balloon over acat figure. Note that both of them have to be installed (using apt-get).

### Things to add in your .bashrc, .zshrc, etc.

I’ll now be adding shell commands to generate the messages with random cowsay characters. [Courtesy](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jackinloadup/732325/raw/422d2175d5561b8d47e19232696c9e043b7b4e37/generate-cowsay).

Now my, [mfdf.sh](https://github.com/orkohunter/mfdf) script adds it to a file and pushes over GitHub.
